1;Valid product;This product was really valid. I was very happy with it and found it comfortable and practical to wear. It is of excellent quality and has accompanied me in many training sessions without any problems. It's just a shame that after many washes it started to fade a little. Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase.;1
2;It makes me sweat;This tank top made me sweat a lot during workouts at the gym. It was actually very tight and constricting to wear. After only half an hour of running I was drenched in sweat. In some places the fabric was almost irritating on the skin. I would not recommend it to anyone due to its lack of comfort.;1
3;NHEIMA tank top.;I purchased this NHEIMA product with good expectations but I must say that it was very disappointing. The size that was sent to me was enormous and kept falling off during physical activity . Furthermore, after just one wash the color is smudged and looks old. I definitely won't buy it again . ;1
4;Difficult to put on.;This tank top proved to be really difficult to put on. The fabric is too stiff and the undercollar is very tight and constricting. I often found myself having to pull and adjust it during training to prevent it from slipping. It doesn't feel pleasant to the touch either. I would avoid it in the future.;1
5; Uncomfortable and large; Unfortunately I have to say that this piece of sports clothing proved to be very uncomfortable to use. The size proved to be too large, making me feel awkward during physical activity . Furthermore, the fabric breathes very little, causing me to sweat unpleasantly. A purchase definitely not to be repeated.;1
6;Bad purchase;With regards to this product I can say that it was a truly terrible purchase. From the first use I realized the poor quality of the materials with which it was packaged. After a very short time of use, swelling and tears appeared in critical points, making it unusable. I strongly advise against it for those looking for solid and long-lasting items.;1
7;Overall very good.;Overall I must say that this tank top was very good and comfortable. It fits perfectly to my body without being too tight and the fabric feels pleasant on the skin even after intense training sessions. Maybe a few small defects in the wash but overall I am very satisfied with the purchase. I recommend it.;1
8;warm;This piece of sports clothing turned out to be very warm to wear. Even during simple gym sessions, after a few minutes I found myself dripping with sweat. Furthermore, the fabric retains bad odors which are almost unbearable. I got rid of it after a short time.;1
9;Purchasing a fitness tank top and leggings;I purchased this set consisting of a tank top and leggings for my gym activities but I was disappointed on several fronts . The size of the tank top is too large and continually slips during movements, while the leggings are excessively tight causing blisters. Low quality materials that are easily damaged. Not to be repeated.;1
10;NOT GOOD;Unfortunately this purchase was not satisfactory at all. From the first use I encountered several problems, from the careless cut to the already frayed seams. In the gym I then realized that the fabric, which was far too thin and transparent, did not provide the necessary coverage. A real shame because the price wasn't low. I don't recommend it.;1
11;Good but fragile;This tank top was overall very comfortable to wear during training and breathable. However, I must point out that after a few washes some of the seams started to come apart, effectively rendering it unusable. A shame because the fabric seemed resistant to the touch. I would avoid other purchases from the same brand.;1
12;Good;I have to say that overall this tank top gave me good feelings. The size is the right one and the breathable fabric ensures maximum comfort even during the most intense sessions. Maybe just a few small cosmetic defects but nothing compromising. Overall I recommend this purchase.;1
13;Good value for money;This piece of sports clothing proved to be a good purchase overall considering the low price. Of course, the fabric is not of the highest quality but it ensures the necessary coverage without affecting breathability. The size corresponds well and I have not encountered any tears or sagging after several uses. Excellent quality /price ratio.;1
14;Does its job well;I must say that this tank top does its job very well. It does not tighten or loosen during exercises and absorbs sweat without retaining unpleasant odors. Even after numerous washes it maintains elasticity and adhesion. Certainly one of the best purchases for my gym sessions. I recommend it!;1
15;I wouldn't buy it again;Unfortunately, I wasn't completely satisfied with this tank top and I think I would hardly buy it again. Although the size is correct, the fabric feels too stiff and rough on the skin even after washing. Furthermore, after a few uses it started to lose elasticity . I'll get rid of it as soon as possible .;1
16; rigid fabric in non-compliant sizes; This piece of sports clothing proved to be a complete disappointment. Both the fabric, which is excessively stiff and rough, and the sizes, which are absolutely non-compliant, make it unusable. Even after the first wash the stitching gave way. A purchase that I strongly advise against, especially in relation to the cost.;1
17; it doesn't smell and the size is right!; I must say that this tank top proved to be a pleasant surprise. The size corresponds to my body perfectly and the fabric, although synthetic, does not retain bad odors even after intense sessions. The low price makes it an excellent purchase for training. I recommend it!;1
18;Disappointed;Unfortunately I was disappointed by this purchase in several respects. From the first use, the tank top revealed already frayed seams and the fabric, as well as being transparent, does not ensure a comfortable fit. A real shame considering the not particularly low cost. I would avoid other purchases from the same brand.;1
19;Too bad!; Unfortunately this tank top did not meet my expectations. Although the shape was nice, the fabric proved to be cheap , revealing what I was wearing underneath, even at the gym. Furthermore, after a few uses it started to tighten noticeably. Too bad because the price wasn't low. I don't recommend it.;1
20;VALID PRODUCT BUT SMELLS TERRIBLY; This tank top has proven to be valid for physical activity thanks to its excellent comfort and breathability . Unfortunately, however, the fabric retains odors poorly, so much so that after training I gave off a truly unpleasant acrid aroma. I think it should be avoided if you have sweating problems or if you use it without changing it daily.;1
21;Sauna tank top; By purchasing this tank top I thought I had gotten a great deal given its advertised breathability . In reality, during training I felt like I was in a real sauna, covered in sweat after just a few minutes. The fabric does not absorb at all and is almost irritating on wet skin. Do not use if you sweat a lot.;1
22;Well done but be careful not to overload your heart; Overall, this tank top proved to be well made and elastic, adhering to the body without being too tight. However, I must say that during very intense workouts I had some slight breathlessness, so I recommend not to overexert yourself if you have heart problems. For the rest the product is excellent . ;1
23;to avoid; Unfortunately, this piece of sports clothing didn't convince me at all and I think it should definitely be avoided. From the first use I noticed how the fabric, very rigid and heavy, made even the simplest movements tiring . In the gym I then retained sweat excessively, causing discomfort. Product not to purchase.;1
24;Slimming tank top; By purchasing this tank top I was hoping to optimize sweating in the gym to improve weight loss. Unfortunately I have to say that it didn't help me lose weight at all: the fabric is too soft and doesn't hold much sweat. Indeed, during more intense physical activity it tended to tighten. Disappointing. ;1
25;Unfortunately it stinks; This tank top has proven to be comfortable and breathable during workouts. However, I must point out that after a few hours of physical activity it started to give off really strong and unpleasant bad smells. A shame, because otherwise it would have been perfect. I only use it for short sessions in the gym.;1
26;to this day I repent and give it up; Unfortunately I bitterly regret this purchase. From the first use I found the seams already frayed and obvious tears. Taking it to the gym was impossible given the poor hold of the fabric. Also considering the cost, I think it is better to return it and choose a more reliable brand next time. ;1
27;Practical and warm enough; Overall, this tank top proved to be very practical thanks to its snug fit that requires no adjustments during training. Furthermore, the fabric is warm and retains sweat even in the most intense sessions. Maybe just a little tight, but overall an excellent purchase.;1
28;Good but...watch the sizes; I must say that this tank top has good features, it is breathable and the shape is nice . However, pay attention to the sizes as it did n't seem to fit the actual shape of my body. To me it seemed slightly lascivious, so I recommend evaluating carefully before purchasing. ;1
29;Tank top; overall this tank top proved to be suitable for my needs. The fabric is soft and breathable, it does not tighten during physical activity . Maybe just a slight cosmetic flaw on one buttonhole but nothing to worry about. Overall satisfied with the purchase.;1
30;Fake description.. No neoprene..; I am disappointed with this purchase made based on a misleading description. In the advert a neoprene fabric was advertised, in reality it is a simple lycra tank top. Needless to say, during training it did not deliver the promised warmth. Brand to avoid.;1
31;Good product but not complete; Overall , this product proved to be valid for my needs, comfortable and well made. However, I must point out that some advertised accessories were missing which made it not completely usable. Too bad, because otherwise the purchase would have been fully satisfactory. I will carefully evaluate completeness next time.;1
32;Good quality/price; I must say that this purchase fully met my expectations in terms of quality and price . The material is robust and breathable, the seams well done. Of course, after many washes the color lost its shine but overall it held up well to the impacts of training. Excellent quality -price ratio. ;1
33;Band; This band has proven to be useful for holding the breasts in place during more dynamic exercises . However, I have to admit that it left some annoying red marks on my skin, making prolonged use inadvisable. Too bad, I hoped it would be more comfortable .;1
34;Slimming tank top; By purchasing this item I hoped to obtain a valid ally in my weight loss journey. Unfortunately I have to say that it performed poorly, not ensuring good thermoregulation. Indeed, during more intensive physical activity it acted more as an obstacle than as a support. Disappointing.;1
35;Like at the petrol station!; I have to admit that wearing this tank top was more like being in a perfumery than in the gym! In fact, the fabric retains odors poorly, giving me a truly unpleasant acrid aroma after just a few minutes of training. I only use it for short and light sessions, otherwise the result is terrible .;1
36;Right; Overall, this tank top met my needs, ensuring the right level of breathability and fit . Perhaps only a few small cosmetic defects after numerous washes but nothing that compromises its use. Overall he represents a good buyer.;1
37;Item conforms to the description; I must say that this item fully corresponds to the description provided in the advertisement. The size is exact , the fabric is soft and breathable. After several uses and washes it is still comfortable to wear. I would definitely buy it again if I had to change it. Recommended product. ;1
38;good product; Overall this tank has proven to be a good product for light workouts. Of course, the fabric is not the best performing in terms of sweat absorption, but it ensures the right fit . Nothing exceptional but overall it represents a satisfactory purchase.;1
39;Impractical; Unfortunately I have to say that these socks proved to be impractical for my needs. In fact, the size was always worn and slipped annoyingly during running or exercises. Too bad, I was hoping they would be tighter . I only use them for light activities.;1
40;Disheartening; I have to admit that I was disappointed with this purchase. After a few uses the fabric started to deteriorate noticeably, with tears in critical points. It was almost impossible to train in the gym . I strongly advise against it, it's better to spend a little more for more resistant items.;1
41;No; Regarding this product I must say that I definitely would not recommend it. In addition to proving uncomfortable and not very breathable during training, after a few washes it lost its shape and grip. Incorrect dimensions and poor material. Absolutely avoid.;1
42;Extender working but not compliant with the technical characteristics; This item has partially satisfied thanks to its elongation functionality, but I must say that the advertised technical characteristics were not respected. For example, the declared elasticity was much greater. A shame, I hoped it would last longer . ;1
43; other than 30-50 meters only a few meters; Unfortunately this purchase was completely disappointing. The advertisement advertised a length of 30-50 meters while in reality the momentum reached just a few metres. Needless to say, it is completely useless for my training needs . I do not recommend purchasing.;1
44;A few problems; Overall this tank top met my expectations by offering a good fit and breathability . Sure, I encountered some small problems, such as frayed seams or chafing points, but nothing compromising for daily use. Overall a good purchase.;1
45;They do their duty.; These technical garments have proven perfectly suited to their purpose of supporting the body during the most intense physical activity. Of course, the material is not the softest on the market but it more than makes up for it by ensuring maximum comfort and breathability. I recommend them for effective workouts.;1
46;Not recommended; I cannot recommend this product. It seems to work poorly and create several problems for the average user. In several reviews, buyers report malfunctions and sub-optimal build quality. Personally I don't consider it reliable and perhaps it would be better to focus on more solid and tested alternatives. To be absolutely avoided, unless you want to risk a negative experience.;1
47;DOES NOT WORK ON CAT 7 SFTP 25 meters; This cable doesn't seem suitable for the long distances it claims to cover, at least for me it didn't work properly. After a few meters of use, signal and connection losses occurred, effectively rendering the product useless for my purpose. The specifications indicated at the time of purchase are probably excessively optimistic and do not reflect the real capacity of the cable. It's a shame, I was hoping for better performances but that wasn't the case . To be avoided at least for distances greater than 10 metres. ;1
48;He created problems.; Unfortunately this product did not prove to be free of defects, creating some problems for me during use. In particular, I encountered unexpected malfunctions and slowdowns that compromised its usability for my purposes. The build quality is perhaps not optimal and would have required a more accurate quality control before being put on sale. I don't consider it a good purchase.;1
49;TV OK but remote control doesn't work; The TV itself works correctly, but I can't say the same about the remote control which was immediately found to be defective. The keys do not always respond to commands and you have to press them several times before any action occurs. This makes using the appliance annoying and impractical. It's a shame, because the screen has an excellent quality/ price ratio, but the faulty remote control greatly diminishes the overall user experience. Maybe it would have been better to spend a little more for a 100% working set.;1
50;Zero reliability; Unfortunately the level of reliability of this product is really poor. I only used it for a short time before it finally crashed unusable. I certainly expected more given the expense incurred, but apparently the construction quality left something to be desired. I will hardly buy from this brand again , I am disappointed by a defective product after just a few weeks of use. Better to choose more reliable brands . ;1
51;PW-HT225PIR Extender; This extender promises to improve the WiFi signal in the home but, at least in my experience, it has failed to live up to expectations. The signal remains weak and inconsistent, forcing me to position the device in places that are not always convenient. Furthermore, the initial set up was more laborious than expected. There are probably better alternatives on the market, this product did not fully convince me. ;1
52; Let's say sufficient but not excellent; I must say that this product has some strengths but overall it does not reach levels of excellence. The quality/ price ratio is decent but some features could be improved to fully satisfy the average user. A few too many inaccuracies and a couple of sporadic malfunctions hinder a completely positive opinion. Overall, however, it behaves in a dignified manner.;1
53;Very bad; Unfortunately this product totally disappointed my expectations, proving to be practically unusable. From the beginning it showed problems and malfunctions that seriously compromised its basic functions. The build quality is really poor and has nothing to do with the description provided by the seller. Truly a bad purchase, which I strongly advise against to anyone. Better to make up for it elsewhere. ;1
54;Salutable and with attention; This is an averagely valid product, which however requires some precautions to function correctly. Non-optimal use can cause too many problems. With a little patience in the installation and initial configuration for � it turns out to be a discreet tool for your � activities . There are certainly better solutions on the market but, if you follow the instructions, it can be satisfying.;1
55;it didn't work on me; Unfortunately I have to admit that this product did not prove suitable for my specific use. After a few uses, a few too many malfunctions occurred , which affected its performance. It is probably an article that does not go well with my personal habits and needs. For others it might be better, but I was not satisfied with this purchase.;1
56;It is important that we do not ingest toxic substances; It is very important when purchasing a product to check that it does not contain harmful substances, however this product does not provide the necessary guarantees from this point of view. The flavor and composition are not clearly indicated and could conceal ingredients that are dangerous for the health, especially of children. Absolutely to avoid if you don't know exactly the composition. Better to opt for more transparent brands.;1
57; Difficult to swallow; This product is too difficult for my digestive system to ingest and digest. The shape and consistency are not optimal and can cause discomfort when taking. I prefer products that are more similar in appearance and flavor to traditional foods, for reasons of comfort. For very sensitive subjects it may be indigestible.;1
58;Good; I must say that this product is quite good and gives me satisfaction . It works correctly, has a good quality / price ratio and is simple to use even for the less experienced. I find it reliable and well made. It fully reflects the description and has never given me any problems. I recommend it without reservation to anyone looking for an efficient solution for their needs . ;1
59;Money badly spent?; There were many expectations about the functionality and durability of this product, unfortunately after a short time the first malfunctions appeared. Now it is practically unusable despite the expense incurred. Maybe I was wrong to rely only on the promises seen during the online purchase, without first checking the opinions of other customers. I will certainly evaluate future investments with more caution .;1
60;It doesn't work for me..; Unfortunately I cannot give a positive opinion of this product, as it did not work properly for my specific needs. After a few uses, malfunctions appeared which;1
61;nothing has changed!; Unfortunately I have to say that I have not noticed any positive changes with this supplement. The tablets have an unpleasant taste and do not seem to have had any effect on my well-being or sporting performance. I've been taking them regularly but it's not worth it. I don't recommend it;1
62;Benefits already after one week; This supplement positively surprised me! After a week of taking it I noticed good water retention and an increase in muscle tone. Furthermore, it gave me energy and is pleasant to take. Given the premises, I believe it will bring substantial benefits if followed over time. Great product!;1
63;Useless; Unfortunately I have to say that this supplement absolutely did not have the advertised effects. In fact, I didn't notice any difference in performance or recovery after sport. The tablets also had a really unpleasant taste. Wasted money, I don't recommend it at all;1
64;Good product; Overall this supplement has proven to be a good product. The tablets are easy to swallow and left no annoying aftertastes. Additionally, I noticed an improvement in my endurance during workouts. It certainly isn't magic but it represents a valid support for physical activity;1
65;It comes in tablets without a particular taste;This supplement comes in practical tablets with a neutral flavor that do not affect the intake. Unfortunately, however , I have to say that after a month of use I have not noticed any benefit on my performance or recovery. A decidedly bland product that didn't convince me.;1
66;TURMERIC+PIPERINE | HIGH DOSAGE; This high-dose turmeric and piperine supplement fully met my expectations. I noticed a considerable anti-inflammatory effect which allowed me to train longer without muscle pain. It also improved my flexibility . Excellent product, I recommend it;1
67; Very uncomfortable tablets that stain; Unfortunately these tablets have proven to be impractical to take. In addition to having a decidedly acrid taste, they had the characteristic of staining fingers. I also didn't feel any physical benefits. Having spent money, I expected more . Not recommended. ;1
68;Good product; Overall this supplement has proven useful for my training sessions. The tablets are easy to take and do not affect the performance of sporting activities. I noticed an improvement in my recovery times. Nothing exceptional but it represents a good purchase;1
69;USELESS!!!; Unfortunately I have to admit that this supplement turned out to be totally useless. It did not bring any improvements, either to psychophysical well-being or to performance. In fact, it sometimes caused me mild nausea. Considering the price, it would have been better to avoid it. Wasted money;1
70;Heartburn only; After just a couple of days of taking this supplement I started to feel annoying heartburn, sometimes even pain. Definitely negative side effects that pushed me to stop the treatment immediately. Product not suitable for my metabolism and not recommended for those suffering from gastrointestinal disorders. ;1
71;No benefit; Unfortunately I have to note that this supplement did not have any beneficial effect after a month of taking it. The tablets did not improve my post-workout endurance or recovery in the slightest. In fact, sometimes they gave me annoying heaviness in my stomach. A completely useless product. ;1
72;"No sweat""plus""classics"; I was disappointed with this supplement advertised to increase sweat production in the gym. In reality I did n't notice any difference, both in thermoregulation and in the abundance of liquids expelled. A product that does not fulfill its promises at all. Better to spend money more profitably ;1
73;I still have to use them but..; I have yet to fully evaluate this supplement but I must say that the conditions are not promising. In fact, the tablets left a disgusting taste in my mouth and often give me mild intestinal problems. If you do not notice any benefits with regular intake, it will be a product to avoid.;1
74;I like them; Overall I have to say that I really like this supplement. The tablets release important nutrients for my psychophysical well-being without leaving bad tastes. Furthermore, I noticed good resistance during even short workouts. Very suitable for those who do moderate activity. I recommend it;1
75;Not very satisfied; Unfortunately I have to admit that I wasn't too satisfied with this supplement. Despite regular intake, I did not notice any increase in performance or post-exertion recovery. In fact, sometimes it caused me slight gastric heaviness. I don't see benefits proportionate to the price paid;1
76;Mismatched sizes; This garment turned out to be a big disappointment due to the incorrect measurement of the indicated sizes. In fact, already after the first wash the trousers felt very tight and at least two sizes too small . It's a shame because the fabric was resistant and the price was affordable, but this flaw makes them practically unusable. I definitely wouldn't recommend them and would pay more attention to the actual dimensions before making other purchases.;1
77;Excellent product; This product is really very good and I was fully satisfied. It washes and sanitizes perfectly, removing even the most stubborn stains. It has an excellent quality / price ratio and is simple and intuitive to use. I find it well built and durable over time. It manages to carry out its task impeccably thanks also to a very powerful engine. I definitely recommend it;1
78;They do not increase sweating; I must admit that these garments live up to their reputation: they absolutely do not increase sweating, on the contrary they significantly reduce it thanks to the breathable fabrics they are made of. Even after long sessions of physical activity I always felt dry and comfortable. A valid alternative for those who don't like heavy and oppressive garments;1
79;Sizes run small.; Unfortunately I had to realize that these trousers are actually quite tight, at least one size below what I usually wear. Even after a wash they have not gained in elasticity and comfort . It's a shame because the fabric is pleasant but the fit is definitely too tight for my tastes. Better to choose more generous sizes ;1
80;Let us not expect miracles; This product proves to be discreet, without infamy and without praise. It's not surprising but it does its job with dignity. Of course, compared to the advertising, its performance is rather average and to fully exploit it requires a bit of skill . Nothing sensational but overall it still represents a good purchase for its basic functions.;1
81;So So; I must admit that this product is rather inconsistent in its performance: sometimes it works well while on other occasions it causes too many problems. Unfortunately, this variability does not make it completely reliable. We need to keep an eye on it and not take anything for granted. Overall, its effectiveness is only moderate and perhaps it is better to focus on more tested brands;1
82;Ugly and not very functional; I was honestly disappointed with this purchase. In addition to being aesthetically questionable, these products proved to be very uncomfortable to wear and not very absorbent. They don't perform their function that well and tend to move around. The price wasn't the cheapest either . Better to focus on more refined and high-performance articles .;1
83;Good purchase, pay attention to the size; This garment has an excellent quality / price ratio but pay attention to the size! Personally it went well for me but reading other reviews I understand that the number varies slightly from the standard measurements. A piece of advice is to always order one size larger to be on the safe side. Otherwise the fabric is resistant and the fit is comfortable . Excellent recommended purchase;1
84;I think one size larger is better; In fact, after trying these pants on, I think I should have gotten a size larger than usual. They are a little tight and not very breathable. With the seasonal weight gain they will definitely tighten me. Next time I will follow the advice of the other reviews and take a size larger , which will certainly be more convenient and comfortable.;1
85;Perfect fit; I have to say that these trousers really fit impeccably and are very comfortable to wear. The soft fabric does not tighten and helps you feel comfortable even during long days. They are also durable and well sewn. Excellent quality -price ratio! I will continue to purchase items of this type that adapt perfectly to my body;1
86;Beautiful; I immediately liked this accessory for its original and colorful design, as well as for its good technical skills. It turned out to be well made and durable, perfect for my days without ever causing problems. He has also been very successful for his captivating and particular style. Definitely a nice product that I willingly wear;1
87;Let's hope so; This new product seems to have good potential but only prolonged use and the reviews of other customers will be able to confirm the quality of the purchase . For the moment, first impressions are positive but there remains a small reservation about its durability over time. Let's keep our fingers crossed and hope that it will live up to expectations.;1
88;Not bad but needs improvement; This product certainly has room for improvement in some aspects that are not exactly refined, but it satisfactorily achieves its main purpose. With a few more precautions it could guarantee even better performance, but it is still a good compromise between quality and price. Nothing exceptional but overall it represents a valid purchase;1
89;Bad quality and practically unwearable; Unfortunately this product proved to be a real disappointment. Not only is the design ugly and cheap, but above all the quality of the materials is terrible . After a few uses it started to deteriorate noticeably. Furthermore, the sizes are not proportionate and it is slippery . A product that is truly not up to par and that I strongly advise against;1
90;Leaves skin very soft; This cosmetic confirmed its excellent formulation, leaving the skin delicately hydrated and soft to the touch. The scent is discreet and the light texture is easily absorbed. An ideal product for my needs without being heavy or greasy. I find it very effective and recommend it to women who like to take care of their skin in a natural way;1
91;Sauna effect;" This video camera proved to be unsuitable for my needs as it tends to overheat, creating an annoying and distracting sauna effect"". Furthermore, the video quality worsens after a short time. It's a shame because the potential is limited . they would be, but that's how it is It is difficult to use for a long time.""";1
92;With 32GB after 5 hours of recording the card is full; Unfortunately I have to say that this memory card proved to be completely inadequate for my video recording needs. In fact, after just 5 hours the memory was completely full, thus not being able to document my outings for long. Disappointing;1
93;INSTRUCTIONS IN ITALIAN? NO!; A major limitation of this product lies in the almost total absence of instructions in Italian, which makes it difficult to use for those who do not perfectly master English. It's a shame, greater accessibility could have enhanced its undoubted potential . ;1
94; Product did not last long; Unfortunately this article didn't last as long as I hoped. After only 2 months of regular use it started to give problems, it stopped recording videos unpredictably. Also considering the price, I expected greater reliability . I don't recommend it;1
95;They sell you the moon but in fact it's just a photo of the moon; I have to admit I was disappointed with this purchase. Excellent features were emphasized in the online promotion that actually did not belong to the product. This is basic equipment despite the cost. Better to read reviews before deciding;1
96;Move on...; Unfortunately this product did not satisfy me in many aspects. In addition to having an unattractive and ergonomic design, the video quality left something to be desired. Fortunately I was able to return it, I will switch to more reliable models for my recordings.;1
97; for the price you shouldn't expect but....; Overall I can't complain about this purchase given the price range. Of course the quality is not optimal and some functions are not very intuitive, but overall it achieves its purpose. Nothing exceptional but not too much to blame either.;1
98;It's pitiful!; Unfortunately I have to say that this product is really poor. The quality of the shots is terrible even in good lighting conditions and the zoom is practically absent. There is no point in talking about stabilisation. Really disappointing quality / price ratio.;1
99;It doesn't work; I was definitely disappointed with this purchase because , despite correct use, the camcorder was never able to start a recording correctly. Completely useless for my needs. I asked for a refund;1
100; Excellent quality/price ratio.; Overall this product fully met my expectations, also considering the affordable price. The shots are sharp and colourful, with good fluidity . The smart functions also proved to be intuitive. Excellent investment;1
101;Detects movement only a few centimeters away. Very short shots.; Unfortunately I must point out that this product has a great limitation in detecting movements, effective only from a few centimeters away. Furthermore, very short recordings are not useful for my surveillance purposes. Disappointing, I will switch to higher performing models ;1
102; Excellent value for money; I must say that overall this purchase turned out to be a good one in relation to the price. Of course the quality is not excellent and some basic functions, but it fulfills the purpose of carrying out surveillance shots well, even with good night vision. Excellent quality / price ratio;1
103;Good; Overall this action camera fully met my needs. The footage is clear even in 4k and the battery lasts a long time. Furthermore, the compact size makes it easy to transport. Nothing exceptional but a great product considering the price.;1
104;Does its job; Overall, this video camera does its job of capturing sports or leisure moments very well. The app is intuitive , the quality of the shots is satisfactory and the stability is good . Maybe some limited but nothing serious. Excellent purchase;1
105;Return requested. It only worked once.; Unfortunately, this product totally disappointed me because , after working only once, it crashed beyond repair. Also considering the investment, I asked for a return under warranty. To be absolutely avoided;1
106;Which is of no use!!!; Unfortunately this product proved to be completely useless for my application. It didn't even manage to perform the basic functions for which it was purchased. Not only does it not work optimally but I would say it is completely unreliable. Money wasted for an item that will not bring any added value. Luckily the price wasn't excessive but I certainly don't recommend it;1
107;Poor; I have to admit that this camcorder fell short of my expectations, proving lacking in several respects. First of all, the quality of the shots is not clear and the colors appear faded. Furthermore, autofocus is not always precise. Performance in low light also drops further. Overall it is too approximate for my purposes.;1
108;I wouldn't take her back; After testing this camera for a few days, I have to say that I wouldn't buy it again. In addition to a non-optimal signal/noise ratio, I encountered the annoying presence of compression artefacts which worsen image performance. Added to this is slow and imprecise focusing. I would focus on more reliable models ;1
109;Works well; I must admit that this video camera fully met my expectations, proving to be accurate and well made. Thanks to the quality optics it manages to capture sharp and detailed images in all light conditions. It also has advanced functions that increase its versatility of use. Truly an excellent purchase for a good quality -price ratio;1
110; Fair product; Overall this camcorder discreetly does its job without infamy or praise. Of course its performance is not excellent but it is able to capture sufficiently clear and stabilized images. Nothing sensational but it still represents a valid solution for those who don't have high budgets. Overall it is an honest product;1
111;Limited; Unfortunately I have to admit that this camcorder has some important limitations, especially in some advanced functions. For example, the automatic autofocus and stabilization are too approximate. Furthermore, manual focus is cumbersome to activate. I would say that it is designed for basic use without too many demands.;1
112;He does his duty; This camcorder proves to be a valid tool for basic home use. It certainly doesn't boast professional functions but it shoots well and stably, optimizing resources and memory. The low price is justified and for less demanding purposes it is more than sufficient. Overall, it carries out the required task in a dignified manner;1
113;It's worthless!; I'm honestly perplexed by this purchase. In addition to the poor performance, this camcorder demonstrated truly precarious build quality. After a short time of use it started to give problems which compromised its functioning. The assistance was also not up to par. Definitely not recommended;1
114;camera angle; Unfortunately, the shooting angle of this camera is too narrow and does not allow me to adequately monitor the entire desired area. Images appear distorted at the edges of the frame. It certainly could have been designed with wide-angle lenses for a wider view . This limitation compromises its effectiveness for my purposes.;1
115;Dissatisfied; I can only be dissatisfied with this purchase. The performance of this video camera is not at all satisfactory, especially the video quality is really poor even with good light conditions. Even basic functions seem rough. It's really not worth the price paid, which is a shame because I was hoping for better results;1
116;For a spy camera, not having night coverage is an important handicap..; This video camera turns out to be lacking in the most important function for my use, namely night vision. In fact, without a suitable infrared LED it would remain in the dark. Thinking about using it as a spy camera, the absence of nighttime shooting is really a serious limitation that makes its use null and void for my surveillance purposes;1
117;DOES HIS DUTY; This video camera fulfills its basic filming function satisfactorily without excessive demands. It certainly doesn't boast professional functions but the images are of good definition and stable. The compact size and long battery life are also great features. Overall I would say it performs well without any problems;1
118;Poor camera; Unfortunately this camcorder proved to be lacking in many respects, disappointing my expectations. Not only is the video quality too poor even in good light, but I had to encounter numerous malfunctions that affected its use. absolutely not recommended;1
119;Do not buy; Based on my experience, I can only strongly advise against purchasing this product. In addition to having very disappointing performances, it quickly developed technical problems that made it virtually unusable. A real shame because I thought it was reliable, but it is better to look at other more reliable models ;1
120;Not bad; This video camera discreetly does its job without infamy or praise. It certainly doesn't boast excellent features but it is still useful for basic surveillance purposes, also thanks to the good quality -price ratio. The shots are not clear but sufficient and I did not encounter any technical problems. Overall a solid purchase;1
121;Waste of money; Unfortunately I have to say that this purchase was a total waste of money. In fact, the earphones, in addition to having a flat sound, were ruined after a short time, rendering them unusable. Too bad, with the price paid I expected greater durability and quality . ;1
122;DISAPPOINTED! they are not what they seem; I was really disappointed with this purchase! The glasses actually did not have the advertised features, in particular the colors were dull and the frames fragile. I returned them, I hope I don't repeat mistakes by reading the descriptions better;1
123;Cute.; These key rings are really nice to look at and not bulky. Of course, the quality of the materials is not excellent but for the use I make of them they are more than fine. I recommend them as an economical but effective gift idea;1
124;How disappointing they are used; Unfortunately these dresses turned out to be a complete disappointment. In the store they looked like new while at home I discovered stains and tears. Despite the discounts, I check the condition better for used clothes. Disappointed;1
125;Only two work; Unfortunately only two of these Bluetooth earphones work properly. The others, however, do not pair or always lose the connection. Too bad, with the price paid I should have had a perfect complete set.;1
126;They are beautiful and they work; I must say that these earphones have proven to be excellent both in terms of comfort and audio quality . Plus, the case allows me to charge them anywhere. Really a good investment at an affordable price. Recommended;1
127;It's not always good to save.; Unfortunately this attempt at saving cost me dearly. The glasses, although cheap, lost their frames after a short time and became unusable. Better to spend more on products that are more resistant and reliable over time;1
128;iPhone 7 battery 📱 ; This battery perfectly solved my smartphone battery life problem. Charging is fast and allows me to get to the end of the day with charge margins. Sturdy and reliable, it was an excellent purchase.;1
129;Correct content just sufficient performance; The supplement respects the declared composition but I must say that the effects are modest. Maybe a slight decrease in tiredness but nothing significant. Also considering the medium-high price I expected more ;1
130;Bad bad case; Unfortunately this case turned out to be really bad from all points of view. Besides being very fragile it doesn't protect the phone at all. It arrived damaged, I immediately replaced it with a better model.;1
131;COVER GOOD LOW QUALITY CARABINER; The cover itself is It is resistant and well made but the clasp broke immediately making it unusable. It's a shame because otherwise it would have been comfortable. Avoid this brand in the future;1
132;I expected more..; Unfortunately I have to admit that I expected slightly more from this perfume, despite the honest price. in fact, the scent is too light and not long-lasting. Nothing shocking but I had a better view of it.;1
133;Good but not excellent; Overall this perfume turned out to be pleasant and well made. It's certainly not the most persistent on the market but it's enough for me to feel it on for several hours. Nothing exceptional but an excellent purchase;1
134;Too light I expected it to be more fruity and persistent; I was a little disappointed by this perfume which was too light and had a short effect. I expected greater body and above all durability over time. Too bad, for the price it could have offered better. I don't recommend it to those who love strong scents;1
135;very bad; Unfortunately this perfume totally disappointed my expectations and revealed itself to be of very poor quality . As soon as it was sprayed the smell was acrid and unpleasant. I returned it, focusing on more reliable brands;1
136; Defective product; Unfortunately this product proved to be defective upon opening the package. Despite the stated pre-sale checks, it highlighted connection problems that made it unusable. Contacted the seller, it was replaced but the first impression remains negative. We need to better certify quality before marketing;1
137;Good but not very good…; This product is overall decent but fails to fully satisfy my expectations. In fact, the audio performance is not excellent and a certain attenuation can be heard in some frequencies. Even the declared autonomy is not that high . Nothing eye-catching but in its market price it could have been done better.;1
138;After a week the battery doesn't hold up; I must admit that the battery of these headphones started to run out very quickly after just a week of use, forcing me to recharge them after a few hours of listening. A shame because the rest of the performance was average, but such limited autonomy actually compromises its usefulness . It certainly could have been improved;1
139;Audio a little poor but comfortable and with excellent battery; Overall these headphones are satisfactory, especially for the comfort and the very long battery life. Unfortunately the audio is not excellent , especially in the bass, but acceptable. Too bad only for some background noise at high volumes. In the price they are still valid.;1
140;Poor audio NOT FOR MUSIC otherwise good product.; I have to admit that these headphones work well for calls and videos, offering good comfort. Unfortunately, music reproduction is not as satisfactory, resulting in poor detail and bass. For listening they require an equalizer. Overall a good product that could offer more in this regard;1
141;Good bluetooth headphones excellent quality/price ratio; These headphones have so far proven to be an excellent purchase thanks to an excellent quality -price ratio. The sound is good and full-bodied, while the battery life easily reaches 20 hours. Bluetooth connectivity is also always stable. Nothing exceptional but they represent a good choice for those who don't have high budgets;1
142;Not bad but if you want more you have to pay more; These headphones guarantee decent listening performance but if you are looking for absolute excellence in sound detail you have to spend more . Nothing to complain about ergonomics and stable connectivity . Overall they offer a good compromise, although the materials are not top of the range. In terms of price, the quality -price ratio is honest .;1
143;Badly bad; I honestly have to consider this purchase as a real mistake. The audio performance of these headphones was in fact very disappointing, with flattened sounds and poor definition. Plus I had several Bluetooth disconnection problems. Really nothing to save except the minimal design;1
144;Does his duty; Despite some small flaws, these headphones manage to perform their audio reproduction function in a dignified and discreet way. They certainly aren't surprising but they offer an honest and unpretentious service, especially given the low price. Nothing exceptional but they still represent a valid choice;1
145;I expected something better when listening to music; Unfortunately I have to admit that the audio quality of these headphones is not up to par for precise and detailed music listening. The bass is not very full-bodied and the sounds are muffled. I wanted a high-performance product but obviously you have to spend more . There remains a bit of disappointment regarding the real capabilities � ;1
146;After a few months defective - TOP battery; Despite a truly long-lasting and resistant battery, after a few months of use these headphones started to give problems, particularly on the left side the sound was attenuated. The materials were probably not sufficiently solid and durable over time. Too bad, if they lasted longer they would be valid;1
147; DURATION 32 DAYS; I must say that the battery life of these headphones is simply exceptional, easily managing to reach 32 hours of continuous playback, as promised. An impressive fact that makes them very comfortable to use without worries. This characteristic alone makes them truly interesting;1
148;Poor quality; Unfortunately I have to admit that the audio quality of these headphones is really poor and disappointing. The sounds are dirty and lacking in detail, unsuitable for fully appreciating the music. A major limitation that compromises its main use. I should have informed myself better before purchasing;1
149;excessive price for the quality of the product.; For the real performance offered, I consider the list price of these headphones excessive. The audio is discreet but not excellent, lacking body and clarity. Materials and finishes are also not refined. They probably would have been more appropriate at a lower price range;1
150; Excellent; These headphones have proven to be truly excellent, capable of providing full and balanced sound, suitable for any musical genre. Thin and comfortable to wear even for long periods. Plus the battery lasts a very long time! Definitely an excellent purchase that I use daily with great satisfaction. Tips generated in response to your command;1
151;Not even used 3 times and they break;I struggled to make these headphones last more than 3 uses before they broke. The sound was fairly powerful but the build quality really leaves something to be desired. After a few hours of listening the pavilion fell off making them unusable. It's a shame because the price wasn't very low but if the durability expectations are so low perhaps it wasn't worth it;1
152;BAD SOUND, RIDICULOUS;The sound of these headphones is really poor, with almost no bass and shrill and annoying highs. They don't do the music and movies justice at all, in fact they ruin them. Furthermore , the design is not particularly comfortable and after a short time your ears start to hurt. Absolutely not recommended;1
153;Change review…;Unfortunately I have to correct my previous positive opinion on these headphones. In fact, after a few months of use, I encountered some serious problems. First of all, the earphones started to lose power and became disturbing. Also, the rubber bands loosened and lost their grip. Unfortunately I have to say that the build quality is not up to the price. It's a shame because the initial sound was discreet. However, their poor durability over time makes them not to be recommended. I would have liked a more solid product . Better to turn to more reliable brands in this respect. In conclusion, these headphones did not meet my long-term expectations despite a promising start.;1
154;Purchase valid based on the type of use you want to make of them;These headphones can be a valid choice if you want an economical product for non-intensive use. The sound is average, sufficient for films and light music if you are not too demanding. The construction doesn't feel flimsy and they should last for occasional use. Perhaps for concentrated listening, higher performing models are advisable but as a low cost solution they do their job;1
155;Discrete but unfortunate;The sound performance of these headphones is discreet and the price is affordable. Unfortunately, after only a few weeks of use the connection jack started to give problems, with the music coming and going. A real shame because I had grown fond of them, I hope my not too intensive use hasn't damaged them too quickly.;1
156;Finally some bluetooth headphones with a working microphone;I have finally found a model of bluetooth headphones with a microphone that works properly! With the many models I tried previously I was disappointed by the poor quality of the audio on calls, but with these the conversations are clear and understandable on both sides. The sound is powerful and detailed, the battery lasts a long time. Definitely worth the price paid;1
157;Uncomfortable Bluetooth headphones.;Unfortunately these headphones proved to be uncomfortable to wear, especially for prolonged periods. The ear cups exert excessive pressure which hurts my ears, forcing me to remove them often. It's a shame, because the audio quality is decent and the price is affordable, but the ergonomics are too lacking;1
158;Very low. I recommend other headphones; Being disappointed by the power of the bass of these headphones, definitely too shy and almost absent, I can only advise against them. The music comes across as flat and unexciting, without that extra push given by the full-bodied bass. Better to turn to other models that give greater emphasis to the lower frequencies . ;1
159;Malfunctioning item;Unfortunately these headphones failed after very few uses, with one of the two earcups stopping working properly. A premature and disappointing malfunction that ruined the purchase. The seller was sorry but there was no way to get a replacement or refund. I do not recommend purchasing this model;1
160;Poor sound;I must admit that I was disappointed by the poor sound quality of these headphones. The bass is almost absent, while the mids and highs are excessively accentuated to the point of being annoying and incapable of faithfully rendering the music. Resistance didn't seem like the strong point to me either, with the earphones tending to become mushy after just a few weeks of use;1
161;Great feedback from the seller;I was very satisfied with the after-sales service. After encountering a problem with the headphones, I contacted customer support and immediately received a prompt response and a replacement of the product as quickly as possible. I appreciate the attention given to the customer which makes this seller reliable in case of need of support;1
162;Broken after a month;Unfortunately after only a month of use these headphones broke beyond repair. A manufacturing defect likely caused the cables inside an earphone to come loose, rendering them unusable. A defective item which due to its short lifespan cannot be considered a good purchase;1
163; Poor bass; I am disappointed by the too weak bass of these headphones. Even by increasing the volume to maximum, the music sounds flat and not very full-bodied in the lower frequencies . It's a shame, because in other aspects such as comfort and design they convinced me, but it is impossible to adequately appreciate the musical pieces without a satisfactory performance of this sound range.;1
164;A filament for resistant and elastic prints;This filament has proven to be resistant to stress and flexible, printing well even objects with complex shapes without breaking. Even when heated, it retained its elasticity , easily returning to its original size once cooled. Definitely suitable for functional printing, it proved to be a valid choice;1
165;Very fragile but is it really PETG?;Unfortunately this filament proved to be too fragile, breaking during simple prints. Furthermore, the cast material did not appear to have the elasticity promised by PETG and tended to chip rather than stretch . A real shame, given that the excellent reviews left us hoping for much better performances. Better to opt for more resistant filaments if you are looking for solid performance;1
166; Excellent product; This PETG turned out to be a truly excellent product. Printability is It is excellent and the mechanical properties are satisfactory. Furthermore, the low price makes it an excellent solution for my experiments. I definitely recommend it to enthusiasts;1
167;Too much post processing; Unfortunately, this filament tends to develop excessive hair during printing, requiring careful post-printing processing. For my projects I am produced with an already optimal finish without interventions. It's a shame because it seemed valid to the touch;1
168;Not among the best petgs but still excellent for quality/price; Overall this PETG performed well considering the affordable price. It is certainly not the smoothest on the market but the adhesion to the bed is excellent . Some problems only in the traces, but nothing that impacts use. Good quality / cost compromise;1
169;Characteristics not from petg; Unfortunately I have to say that this filament does not respect the characteristics of a standard PETG. In fact, it tends to stratify and has poor printability , especially in thin parts. Disappointing, I expected better performance. Not recommended;1
170;Good petg. Excellent adhesion; This green PETG has proven to be an excellent product. The adhesion to the plate is excellent as is the definition of even complex shapes. Furthermore, the color is bright and saturated. Highly recommended;1
171;PETG green difficult but ok; I must admit that I struggled quite a bit to print with this green PETG which often tore. However, after various experiments I obtained satisfactory results also thanks to the solidity of the material. It takes patience;1
172; first PETG with alfawise u30 pro; This was my first test with a PETG and I must say that overall it went well thanks also to the quality of the filament. Sure, some imperfections but nothing that can't be improved with experience. Great starting point;1
173;Power q20 pro headphones; Unfortunately these headphones, in addition to having a flat sound, failed after only 3 months of regular use. A manufacturing defect permanently compromised the left earphone. Disappointing for an expensive product.;1
174;Good for the price but....; Overall these headphones offer a good quality / price ratio. The sound is satisfactory even if not the best. Unfortunately, after a few months the elastic of the case broke , compromising its practicality . Other models to evaluate;1
175; Defective product; Unfortunately, these headphones arrived defective, with the left earpiece housing broken. Transportation accident or factory problem, I don't know. The seller did not want to replace them. Too bad, I would have liked to try them;1
176; after 3/4 months they no longer charge; I was disappointed by these headphones whose charger stopped working after just 3-4 months. Needless to say, at that point they became useless. Not very stable, better to choose more reliable brands ;1
177;Donerton T12 - Defective right headset or right side magazine? Just hypotheses.; Unfortunately these headphones stopped working on the right side after only 10 days of normal use. It is impossible to establish whether it is the fault of the earphone or the USB charger, the fact is that they totally need to be replaced. Disappointing;1
178;Bluetooth headphones;These Bluetooth headphones proved to be a good purchase overall. The sound is clear and they have excellent battery life. Unfortunately, however, the material of the headband is fragile and tends to deteriorate. Nothing serious but needs improvement;1
179;Comfortable but not working after only 10 days; Overall these headphones satisfied my needs thanks to the good ergonomics and effectiveness of the touch controls. Unfortunately , as some reviews have already reported , after a short time the case completely stopped charging the earphones;1
180;Do not buy; I strongly advise against purchasing these headphones, which after less than a month of use have shown serious operating defects. In particular, Bluetooth pairing becomes impossible and battery life practically non-existent. Obvious production problems;1
181;verified purchase; I can confirm that this was a really good verified purchase. The product proved to be precise, reliable and durable in the long term, fulfilling its function perfectly. Nothing to say other than praise for the construction quality and the excellent quality -price ratio. Definitely recommended;1
182;decent product but they have a defect if used for sports; These headphones are overall discreet but those who use them during sporting activities may have some problems. In fact, they tend to move and not adhere perfectly to the ears when you sweat or move a lot. Perhaps more stable materials or headband would have made them more suitable for sports too.;1
183;Excellent in many respects but lacking in sound quality; These headphones undoubtedly have good comfort and excellent battery life but unfortunately the audio quality is not up to the standard of the best products. The sounds appear a little dull and lacking in detail. It's a shame because the design is pleasant , they could have done more in this respect;1
184;They don't work; Unfortunately I have to point out that these headphones don't work at all. From the first use the audio from one earphone was distorted and unlistenable. Contacted the seller, the replacement also gave problems. Clearly they cannot be trusted. Better to focus on other more solid brands. ;1
185;Fooled by positive reviews; I remain disappointed after purchasing these headphones, deceived by positive ratings which in reality did not reflect the quality of the product. In addition to a flat sound, I encountered various malfunctions after just a few uses. You definitely need to take user reviews with a pinch of salt;1
186;Sound quality no problems with the right earphone after a month; Unfortunately I cannot give a good opinion on these headphones: the audio was immediately poor in detail, furthermore after just over a month the right earphone stopped working as it should. Certainly the qualitative performance does not correspond to the asking price. I don't consider them reliable;1
187; cables not soldered; A big flaw of these headphones is represented by the power and audio transmission cables, which apparently are not soldered correctly. After a few months of use they stopped, effectively preventing use . Poor workmanship which compromises its durability;1
188;the sound is good but they fall out of the ears too often; The sound from these headphones is quite good and full-bodied but unfortunately they continually fall out of the ears even during simple activities , making listening difficult. Perhaps it would have been better to adopt firmer bows . Too bad, they could do more in this aspect.;1
189;It's a shame they stopped working; Unfortunately I have to note that these headphones literally stopped working after just a few months, for no apparent reason. Obviously there is now no guarantee for replacement. A real shame given the initial potential;1
190;I don't return out of pure laziness but:; Although it is clear that these headphones do not work properly, out of sheer laziness I will not return them . However, I recommend avoiding them, since the problems encountered are quite serious and likely in other cases. Better to choose more reliable names . ;1
191;Unsatisfactory; Unfortunately I have to say that these headphones did not fully satisfy me. The sound is poor in detail and the fit is not optimal , they often slip. Even the autonomy is not as excellent as promised. There are certainly better products in their price range;1
192;Problems after a while; After a very short time of use, these headphones started to show problems, particularly on the right side where the volume was partially attenuated . A clear sign of poor quality is the materials which would hardly have held up over time. Product to avoid;1
193;Potentially excellent but...; These headphones seemed to have good potential - but alas - I had to encounter a series of defects that affected their effective use. In particular, the autonomy was well below the declared one and the waterproofness was absent . Too bad, they could have given more ;1
194;Good headphones with good durability; I must admit that these headphones guarantee good service, with balanced sound and a long-lasting battery. They are also comfortable to wear even for hours. Nothing astonishing but they represent an honest choice that works as it should. I recommend them;1
195; not suitable for listening while running; Unfortunately I must say that these headphones are not suitable for use during dynamic sporting activities such as running. In fact, they dance too much and tend to break away with their movements. Better to choose models that are firmer and anchored to the ears for comfortable listening while training for the file Batch_14.csv;1
196;Product above expectations. Less battery!;These headphones really surprised me with their audio quality, well above the price paid. The bass is full-bodied, while the mids and highs are well balanced. Unfortunately, the battery lasts too short, with an autonomy of only 3-4 hours of continuous playback, forcing me to recharge them often. It's a shame because if it weren't for this flaw they would be truly flawless. ;1
197;Good for hands-free communication;These headphones have been perfect for my on-the-go music listening needs, thanks to the touch controls that let you manage tracks and calls without having to take out your phone . The sound is clear and the bass is full-bodied, with a good seal in the ear even when I'm running. I fell in love with them and am still using them with satisfaction;1
198; Excellent value for money; The quality -price ratio of these headphones is truly excellent. The sound is powerful and balanced, while the battery life allows me to use them for hours without recharging them. Furthermore , the comfortable fit makes them suitable for even the most intense training sessions . Definitely a purchase that did not disappoint me;1
199; Review update 2 months after purchase; After two months of use, I am still satisfied with these headphones. The sound remains powerful and detailed, while the Bluetooth connection is always stable. The only flaw I'm experiencing is the seal in the ear when I sweat profusely, with an earphone that sometimes tends to come out, but nothing compromising. Overall they continue to do their job well. ;1
200; Item can be improved; These headphones have an excellent quality -price ratio but some details could be improved. For example, the fit is not the most comfortable and after a short time the ears start to hurt. Furthermore, the battery doesn't last as long as hoped. Nothing serious but if these small defects are resolved they could represent an even better buyer;1
201;fall; Unfortunately after a few weeks of use the earphones started to no longer be securely anchored to the clips, making them unstable and fall prone. A design flaw that quickly nullifies its use, forcing me to look for a more reliable model;1
202;Absolutely not adequate; These headphones proved to be totally unsuitable for my music listening needs during workouts. The earbuds don't fit well in my ears and constantly fall out, preventing me from concentrating on physical activity. The sound is flat and metallic. I had to put them in the drawer after very few uses.;1
203; Not even 3 months old; After just 3 months one earphone suddenly stopped working, rendering these headphones unusable. A time that was really too short before they failed, disappointing me due to the lack of reliability they demonstrated . The seller didn't want to replace them, which was a shame because the price wasn't very low;1
204;The little box hisses and they connect even when the box is closed; These headphones, when closed in their case, continue to pair with my cell phone, emitting strange hissing sounds. An operating defect that annoys me and I fear it could drain the battery unnecessarily. Furthermore, the earphones sometimes struggle to connect to each other. Problems of youth - which I hope will improve with software updates. ;1
205;I've tried better; Unfortunately, after having tried headphones from more famous brands, this economical model disappoints expectations in terms of quality. The sound is flat and lacks bass, making the music less engaging. Furthermore, the earphones do not fit perfectly in the ears. You will return to better performing headphones by paying a little more ;1
206;0;"Unfortunately I have to give a totally negative opinion on this purchase. In fact, these headphones are completely unusable right from the moment you open the package. In fact, the earphones do not emit any sound, with a volume stuck at ""0."" Definitely a serious manufacturing defect that makes the product completely unusable for its purpose. It's really a shame, especially considering the price paid. I can't help but strongly advise against this purchase. This is clearly defective goods that the seller should promptly replace. Brands like these who put non-working products on the market should undoubtedly be avoided. I am disappointed to see how important companies can distribute defective headphones already ready for use. I hope in the future there will be more accurate quality controls to protect customers.""";1
207;You can hear the speaker but on the other end they don't hear you; Unfortunately, the microphone integrated into these headphones does not do its job adequately. The speaker is heard in a metallic and distorted way, but at the same time I myself am unable to be audible to the interlocutor. A serious flaw that completely nullifies its use for calls;1
208; Bluetooth 5.1 Headphones Enhanced Bass Wireless Sports Earphones IP7 Waterproof; These headphones proved to be perfect for my workouts thanks to the IP7 certification which makes them completely impervious to sweat. The bass is full-bodied without being excessive, while the fit is It is also optimal for the most dynamic sessions. The battery also lasts several hours. Definitely an excellent purchase for those who practice sports;1
209;Good at first... then throw away!; At the beginning these headphones convinced me, with a good quality -price ratio. Unfortunately, after only 2 months the audio from one earphone started to lose power until it disappeared completely. Evidently it was a production defect that caused its rapid degradation. I do not recommend purchasing given the lack of reliability demonstrated .;1
210;They do their duty; These headphones discreetly do their job of playing music and managing calls on the go. The sound is average and the battery lasts a long time. Nothing exceptional but for the use I make of them, i.e. occasional listening during walks and house cleaning, they fully do their duty without complaints;1
211; Excellent; These wireless headphones have proven to be really good. The sound is clear and detailed, the pairing is instant and the battery life is excellent. Furthermore, they are comfortable even for the longest hours . Fortunately, a good and long-lasting purchase;1
212;Disappointed; Unfortunately I was very disappointed with these headphones. In fact, after a few days of use, the internal connections were irremediably broken. It goes without saying that they are now useless despite the not low price. I will definitely avoid this brand. ;1
213; Defective charging base; Unfortunately, the charging base of these headphones was damaged after just a month, causing the connection with the earphones to break. A real shame because the sound was satisfactory. I hope to be entitled to a replacement but I am wary of the brand;1
214;Good but not very good; Overall these headphones proved to be average. The sound is discreet and the battery life is satisfactory. Unfortunately, after a few months the elastic of the case loosened , making it difficult to close. Nothing serious but I expected more ;1
215; Very well made, excellent value for money; I have to say that these headphones exceeded my expectations also considering the price range. The sound is clear , the fit is comfortable and the battery life is excellent. Furthermore, the construction quality is excellent . Truly a great purchase;1
216;Bluetooth headphones; Unfortunately I have to report that these Bluetooth headphones failed after a few months of regular use. In fact, the earphones no longer pair correctly with the base, causing continuous interruptions. Production problems that discourage its use;1
217; Duration Short; I was disappointed by these headphones whose lifespan was very limited over time. In fact, after just 2-3 months, the earphones started to lose power until they turned off completely. Also considering the cost, I expected greater reliability � ;1
218;After less than a month of use the two earphones dissociate from each other and no longer pair; Unfortunately these headphones turned out to be defective after less than a month. In fact, the two earphones no longer connect the base stably , breaking the Bluetooth connection in an unpredictable way. Design problem that makes them unusable;1
219;Maluccio; I have to say that these headphones disappointed me in several aspects. The sound is flat and unclear, the fit is precarious and the battery doesn't last long. Furthermore, after a few uses the charging torch no longer works . Definitely not a repeat purchase;1
220;Great disappointment; I was very disappointed with this purchase. The headphones, in addition to being uncomfortable, failed after just a few days of use, making the right earphone disconnected. Also considering the cost, I certainly expected greater longevity . Production problems;1
221;After less than a month of use the right earphone no longer works; Unfortunately, these headphones also suffered a malfunction in one earpiece, specifically the right one, after just a month of use. A real shame because they were comfortable but clearly of poor quality . I can't help but advise against purchasing it;1
222;low quality and low sound; I have to say that the sound of these headphones was really poor and low. Furthermore, the fit was precarious. After a while I replaced them with a better model that finally enhances my music. Totally non-repeatable purchase;1
223;Earphones good for listening to music not for calls; Unfortunately I have to say that these headphones proved to be unsuitable for calls even though the sound for music was discreet. In fact, microphones capture too much external noise, making the voice difficult to understand. Ok just for listening;1
224;Two out of two returns; I was disappointed with this twice repeat purchase. In fact, both headphones, although working at the beginning, after a few months stopped connecting stably causing continuous short circuits. Clearly manufacturing defects;1
225;I thought they were excellent but after 3 months they no longer work!; I thought I had made an excellent purchase but unfortunately after just 3 months the headphones were irremediably damaged. In fact, the earphones no longer connect and the battery is completely flat. Disappointed, I had to throw them away despite the price;1
226;Exaggerated bass. Excellent battery life.;The bass of these headphones is so powerful that it is almost excessive. Even at minimum volume the music is too heavy on the low frequencies, nullifying the quality of the medium and high sounds. It's a shame, because otherwise the sound is good and the battery lasts a long time between charges. If they were adjustable the audio balance would be perfect;1
227;Unfortunately disappointed;Unfortunately these headphones failed to convince me. The sound is flat and metallic, devoid of details, while the bass is completely absent. Furthermore, earphones quickly become uncomfortable to wear. Torner is on the market looking for a model with better quality performance.;1
228;Returned as not working; After a few days one of the earphones stopped working. Since they are expensive headphones, I returned them to replace them but unfortunately the second pair purchased also had the exact same defect. Evidently there is a reliability problem with this model which I prefer to avoid by purchasing another one;1
229;Bass too powerful; The bass of these headphones is too strong, sometimes almost annoying. Even by lowering the volume to minimum the music is excessively loaded on the low frequencies. It's a shame, because otherwise the sound is good , but this flaw makes them inadvisable for those who love balanced listening.;1
230; Convenient to carry it when you run.; These headphones are very comfortable to wear even when I'm running, thanks to the earphones firmly anchored to the ears. The sound is powerful and the bass is full-bodied, perfect for my training sessions. The battery also lasts several hours, allowing me long rides without having to recharge it.;1
231;WIRELESS HEADPHONES; The sound of these Bluetooth headphones is average, perhaps slightly lacking in bass, but nothing compromising. Unfortunately, after a few weeks of use, one of the earphones started not always connecting, effectively rendering them unusable. It's a shame that the duration is so short , I don't recommend them;1
232;Great sound but uncomfortable; The sound is really excellent, powerful and detailed, however after a few minutes the earphones start to hurt my ears making prolonged listening difficult. It's a shame, because the quality -price ratio is excellent , but the comfort is It is an essential requirement that these headphones do not satisfy.;1
233;Very disappointed; I was really disappointed by these headphones which after very few uses started to not connect correctly, as if the devices were struggling to recognize each other. A defect that made them impossible to use, forcing me to return them. I expected greater reliability � ;1
234;Forget it; Unfortunately these headphones are not suitable for my use. The sound is excessively pushed on the bass in an unnatural way, while the highs are annoying. Additionally , after a few weeks, one earphone stopped working. I strongly advise against them.;1
235;Reconsideration on Bluetooth 5.1 Headphones Enhanced Bass Wireless Sports Earphones IP7; After purchasing and returning these headphones due to a defect, I decided to give them a second chance hoping it was an isolated case. Unfortunately I have to change my mind, the bass is excessive and one of the earphones broke again. Evidently there is a reliability problem - I can't recommend them;1
236;bought the item 2 times but with the same defect; I purchased these headphones twice, hoping that I had gotten a defective model the first time. Unfortunately, both products had the exact same problem: after a few weeks one of the earphones stopped working. Disappointed, I give up on the brand.;1
237;Not suitable for running;" These headphones really do not prove to be suitable for running. The earphones do not fit securely to the ears and tend to move, making the fit uncomfortable and distracting from training. Plus, the sound is not full-bodied enough to ""simulate"" the presence of live music";1
238;Bluetooth headphones; The sound of these headphones is flat and metallic, devoid of details, with almost non-existent bass which makes the music indifferent to listen to. Also, after a few weeks of use, one earbud stopped connecting properly. Very disappointed, I do not recommend them;1
239;Poor quality; Unfortunately, the audio quality of these headphones is truly insufficient, with poorly defined mids and highs and completely poor bass delivery. A flat and metallic sound that undermines musical listening. Even the response to touch commands is sometimes uncertain. Nothing justifies the price paid;1
240;Poor quality headphones with exaggerated bass; The sound of these headphones is characterized by exaggerated and excessive bass which ends up completely overpowering the other registers, making reproduction distorted and unnatural. Even the seal in the ears becomes uncomfortable after a short time. Surely you can find better ones;1
241;Useful for playing sports but that's it; This watch proved to be useful for tracking my sports performance but I must say that the advanced functions promised did not live up to it. It also proved uncomfortable on the wrist during more intense workouts . Nothing exceptional, enough for light activities;1
242; very very high quality/price ratio; I must say that these headphones fully satisfied the quality -price ratio. The sound is clear and powerful, the connectivity is excellent Bluetooth . Sure some aesthetic defects but nothing that affects daily use. Excellent low cost purchase.;1
243;defective product; Unfortunately these headphones arrived defective, with the microphone not working. Contacted the seller and he refused to replace them. Too bad, I would have liked to check the quality but it was impossible. To avoid;1
244;I don't know; Unfortunately I cannot adequately comment on this product as it is defective . In fact, the earphones did not pair stably, causing continuous audio interruptions. Dissatisfied, I had to return them without being able to test them;1
245;defective products; Both pairs of headphones purchased had serious functional defects such as intermittent connections or non-working microphones. Clearly production problems to be sanctioned. Refunder is the purchase;1
246;Good product for what it costs but I expected more; Overall these headphones were satisfied considering the price. Of course, the sound is not excellent and the battery does not last long but they serve the purpose for non-demanding listening. I expected a little more given the expense.;1
247;Good but disposable.....; Unfortunately these headphones turned out to be too basic and dated. In fact, after a few uses the earphones were irreparably ruined. Too bad, I thought they would last longer . Better to spend a little more for more solid products;1
248;Good sound but struggles to keep Bluetooth connected; These headphones ensure good sound even if they sometimes struggle to maintain Bluetooth stably. Furthermore, after a few months the battery life decreased significantly. Nothing serious but they could have been more resistant ;1
249;Annoying and crackling background noise; Unfortunately, these headphones have an annoying and persistent background noise that makes listening unpleasant. Even when you turn the volume down to minimum it's audible . Certainly not satisfactory in this respect.;1
250;Disappointment; I was really disappointed by these headphones which, in addition to being uncomfortable, gave off an annoying rustling sound with every movement. Furthermore, after 2 months the Bluetooth connectivity has become a dancer. I don't recommend them;1
251;BLUETOOTH 5.1 HEADPHONES; These headphones have proven to be good overall thanks to Bluetooth 5.1 technology which guarantees an excellent signal even at long distances. Unfortunately they suffer from poor battery life. Nothing serious but can be improved;1
252;They are worth what you spend.; As expected, these budget headphones fully reflect the purchase price. The sound is only reasonably clear and the fit is precarious . However, if you are looking for a low cost solution, they represent an option to evaluate;1
253;Headphones that are worth what you pay.; These headphones have proven to be valid for occasional and non-intensive use. Sure, the sound isn't excellent and the battery doesn't last long, but they allow you to listen to music or podcasts without spending too much. Nothing exceptional;1
254;They don't move you won't lose them; Overall these headphones turned out to be an excellent purchase considering the low price. They never slip thanks to the rubber anchor and ensure good sound. Really practical and recommended for sports use;1
255;Discrete product, I do not recommend.; Unfortunately these headphones did not convince me especially for the quality -price ratio. The sound is flat and there is no insulation, furthermore after 2 months the battery life has almost halved. Nothing long-lasting, I don't consider them a good investment;1
256;Practices; These headphones have proven to be very practical for my daily use. Very light and comfortable to wear even for long periods. The Bluetooth connectivity is always stable and the quality is audio is satisfactory . Furthermore, the battery has excellent life. Nothing flashy but they undoubtedly represent a functional and efficient choice;1
257; Bluetooth 5.1 headphones Enhanced Bass Wireless Sports Earphones IP7... never again; I must say that these headphones are actually excellent for sporting activities thanks to their sturdiness, waterproofness and resistance to movement. The bass is full-bodied and the connectivity is always present. Unfortunately, the battery life was lower than declared but overall they remain a valid purchase for those who love to train while listening to music.;1
258;Bluetooth headphones; These practical Bluetooth headphones discreetly perform their task of audio reproduction while on the move. The sound is average and the connection is stable. Nothing exceptional but they represent an excellent solution due to their ease of use and affordable price. They represent a reliable purchase;1
259;Waiting for assistance; Unfortunately, after a very short time these headphones showed some problems that compromised their regular use. I have contacted support who, I hope, can support me in resolving these problems. I'm waiting for an answer that will change my mind about their reliability � ;1
260;Light pleasant easy.; I must admit that these headphones are very comfortable to wear, light and pleasant. Furthermore, the connection is always stable without pairing difficulties. In short, they are practical and easy to use even for those who are not experts . A good honest product for its basic functions;1
261;Disappointing! Already broken!; Unfortunately, these headphones proved to be decidedly disappointing: right from the first use they showed annoying sound and connection defects. After just a week they were practically useless. Much worse than I expected considering the cost. Absolutely to avoid;1
262;Do not buy them; I honestly advise everyone not to buy these headphones, as they have given obvious problems after just a few days of use. Unfortunately I was unable to request a return, but they certainly work badly and will prove defective in the short term. Better to choose other models;1
263;I do not recommend purchasing it; Unfortunately, based on my brief experience, I can only strongly advise against purchasing these headphones. In addition to poor construction quality and materials, they have highlighted several malfunctions that compromise their effective use. Better to go elsewhere;1
264;Good but....; These headphones have some strengths such as good comfort and decent battery life, but unfortunately they suffer from barely sufficient audio quality, lacking detail and sound body. Nothing serious but for musical use they could give something more . ;1
265;Good purchase recommended by my son; I have to thank my son for this suggested purchase: the performance of these headphones has proven to be excellent for the use I usually make of them. Nothing exceptional but they represent a good quality -price ratio which makes them reliable for their purpose;1
266;Stable on the ear for the bike; These headphones proved to be perfect during my cycling trips, remaining stable in their place even on the most demanding descents, without moving or falling. Excellent seal which makes them the ideal companion for the cyclist, facilitating comfortable listening in every situation;1
267;Disappointment; Unfortunately I have to admit that I was disappointed with these headphones. In fact, after a very short time of use, they started to lose audio power and cause connection problems. Clearly an operating defect that compromises its reliability over time. Too bad, I hoped for better;1
268;Total bin; Honestly, these headphones turned out to be a real waste. Already from the first uses I encountered serious malfunctions that made them unusable. Such a manufacturing defect is unacceptable , even in relation to the price paid. Absolutely avoid this purchase;1
269;to forget; Unfortunately I have to say that it is better to completely forget about purchasing these headphones. In fact, after a few days of use one of the earphones stopped working properly. Clearly an unreliable product, which will certainly disappoint those who choose it in the short term;1
270; Broken after 4 months; I was very disappointed to learn that after just 4 months of normal use these headphones finally broke. An unmistakable sign of poor construction quality which does not guarantee durability over time. Impossible to consider them a long-lasting purchase;1
271; Disposable product; Unfortunately these headphones have proven to be truly disposable, despite the not low price. After just two months of normal use the earphones started to lose power and stopped working, forcing me to replace them. I would have preferred a longer life given the cost. I can't recommend them;1
272;they looked excellent...; At first these headphones seemed excellent to me, with a full-bodied and detailed sound. Unfortunately, after a few weeks one of the earphones started disconnecting frequently, and then stopped working altogether after just a month. Too short a time before they failed;1
273;Bluetooth 5.1 headphones; The sound of these Bluetooth headphones is powerful and balanced, with full-bodied bass without being excessive. Battery life is also excellent . Unfortunately, after a few months of use, the microphone started to give problems, picking up the voice poorly during calls. I hope it can be resolved with updates. ;1
274;Always broken.; After purchasing this model of headphones three times, each time the earphones stopped working after a few months. Evidently there is a structural problem that compromises its reliability over time. I was forced to give up, I prefer to spend a little more for a more solid product;1
275; Excellent headset, mediocre microphone; The sound of these headphones is excellent , powerful and balanced in all frequencies. Unfortunately during calls my voice is often picked up in a metallic and robotic way, making it indistinct for the interlocutor. Too bad about this microphone defect.;1
276;Bad purchase; Unfortunately I have to reject this purchase, disappointed by the poor quality of these headphones. The sound is flat and metallic, completely devoid of full-bodied bass. Also, after a few weeks, one earbud became unstable in connection. Nothing justifies the price paid;1
277;Practical;These headphones proved to be ideal for my workouts thanks to the comfortable and firm fit. The earphones don't fall out even when I sweat or make fast movements. The sound is powerful to motivate me during the run. Practical and economical.;1
278;Not working.; Unfortunately these headphones have not worked since purchase, with the earbuds not connecting to each other. I had to return them as defective. A shame because the design seemed comfortable but the construction quality was lacking;1
279; poor waterproofness; Despite the IPX certification, these headphones were actually not at all impervious to sweat during workouts. After a few uses the earphones suffered damage which compromised their functioning. Lack of reliability � ;1
280;Bad audio; Disappointed by the flat and tinny audio of these headphones, completely lacking in full-bodied bass. The music is very uninvolving and difficult to listen to for long. The fit is also not the best. Impossible to recommend them;1
281;I wouldn't buy them again; Unfortunately, after having encountered connection problems and frequent drops of the earphones, I can only reject this model of headphones. I would definitely not buy them again, given the demonstrated structural limitations;1
282;I DON'T FIND THEM PRACTICAL; These headphones are not at all practical for my workouts, with heavy earpieces that don't sit securely in my ears and risk falling out, especially when I sweat. Even managing the touch controls is cumbersome . Not suitable for my sporting activity;1
283;Good but cumbersome to use; The sound of these headphones is average but unfortunately the management of the touch controls is not very intuitive and slow. I often have to make several attempts before I get the desired command right. Nothing compromising but they can be cumbersome when listening.;1
284;Disappointed; I was disappointed with the durability of these headphones over time. After a few months of use one earbud started disconnecting frequently, making them unreliable. The sound wasn't the best either, with not very full-bodied bass. Nothing that justifies the price paid;1
285;Unpretentious; These economical headphones discreetly perform their task of music reproduction during my walks. The sound is not the best but sufficient and the battery lasts a long time. Nothing exceptional but for the occasional use I make of them they are unpretentious.;1
286;Very disappointing sound quality; Unfortunately I have to say that the audio quality of these headphones was really poor and disappointing, far too low even at maximum volume. Absolutely not satisfactory for the value spent. I do not recommend this purchase;1
287;Good product, attention to wearability; Overall these headphones offer good value for money . However, pay attention to the fit - it is precarious on some sizes. After a short time they caused discomfort for me. Nothing compromising but worth considering.;1
288;Beautiful but not long-lasting; These headphones turned out to be aesthetically beautiful but unfortunately did not last long over time. In fact, after a few months of regular use the earphones started to deteriorate. Too bad, I was hoping for greater resistance for the price range;1
289;Disappointment; Unfortunately these headphones totally disappointed me. In addition to having a crackly and distorted sound, after just a month of use the right earphone was irremediably broken. Total disappointment, I had to throw them away;1
290;They can't hear you!; Unfortunately, these headphones do not ensure a sufficiently high volume of my voice during phone calls, so much so that I struggle to be understood by the interlocutor. Unusable for conversational purposes. Too bad about the rest;1
291;pretty good; Overall these headphones have proven to be quite good for my use. Of course the sound is not excellent but they allow you to listen to music or make phone calls discreetly. Nothing exceptional but overall satisfactory;1
292;No longer reloads; I was disappointed by these headphones whose battery definitively stopped charging after a few months, effectively rendering them unusable. Also considering the price, I would have liked greater longevity . To avoid;1
293;THEY LASTED ONE DAY; Unfortunately, these headphones failed after just one day of use, with one of the earpieces stopping working. Clearly a production problem that totally advises against purchasing it. Refund promptly;1
294;Do not repeat purchase; I definitely recommend avoiding purchasing these headphones. In addition to being stiff and noisy, after 2 months they broke irremediably. Even the brand refused to replace them. Disappointing and unreliable;1
295;I had problems; Unfortunately I had some problems with these headphones whose Bluetooth system was unstable and discontinuous. Often the connection dropped suddenly. Nothing solvable, I replaced them with another model;1
296;Sin; Too bad, these headphones had a good quality -price ratio but after just 3 months of use the left earphone stopped working properly. Considering the costs, I expected greater longevity � ;1
297;They work well; Overall these headphones have proven to be reliable. The sound is clear , the battery life is excellent and the fit is optimal even for the most intense sports sessions. Nothing extraordinary but they undoubtedly represent a good investment;1
298;From my personal opinion n; From my personal opinion I can only recommend the purchase of these very good headphones. Very light and comfortable, they allow you to fully enjoy music and phone calls at a more than affordable cost. Really excellent;1
299;Terrible; Unfortunately these headphones turned out to be a real disappointment. In addition to being uncomfortable and noisy, after just a few uses both earphones stopped working properly. I highly recommend more reliable products ;1
300; Running headphones; These in-ear headphones are completely unsuitable for intensive sports activity . In fact, during the run they tended to slip out of position causing distractions. Better models with a headband or specifically aimed at sport;1
301;They log out on their own; Unfortunately I have to point out that these headphones tend to disconnect very frequently even at a short distance from the source device, forcing me to constantly pair them. Bluetooth is certainly a serious connectivity flaw which compromises its fluid and continuous use. Evidently there is some problem in the wireless protocol;1
302;Lasts a few hours and then....; These headphones guarantee discreet listening for only a few hours, after which the battery runs out quickly forcing me to recharge daily. An autonomy that is too limited which in fact precludes prolonged use away from the socket. They could have done much better in this respect;1
303; bought twice, same problem (headphone charging doesn't work) - returned both; Unfortunately I must point out that I purchased these headphones twice in the hope of solving the problem, but in both cases the charging system stopped working after a short time, effectively rendering them unusable. Clearly there is a manufacturing defect that makes them totally unreliable;1
304;After 2 months they stopped working.; I can only be disappointed by these headphones, after just two months of normal use they definitively stopped working, probably due to poor construction quality. A time that is too short which demonstrates its short duration over time. Impossible to consider them a good investment;1
305;Pleasant surprise; I have to say that these headphones turned out to be a pleasant surprise. They guarantee an excellent full-bodied sound and long-lasting battery. They are also very comfortable. The low price makes the quality -price ratio excellent. Definitely an excellent choice to recommend;1
306;Good for music.; These headphones prove to be very good for listening to music, thanks to a balanced and detailed sound, ideal for fully appreciating the songs. Little to say, except that they keep their promises and prove perfect for my uses. ;1
307;A headset no longer works after 1 month; Unfortunately after only a month of use one of the earphones stopped working properly. Clearly the durability is too limited which shows that the product is not at all resistant over time. It is difficult to consider it a reliable choice;1
308;Beautiful but they dance!; The audio performance of these headphones is good overall but the problem is that during physical activity the earphones tend to move a lot and do not fit perfectly. A flaw that compromises its effectiveness in the gym or while running. ;1
309; good value for money; These headphones offer excellent value for money . The sound is full-bodied and the connectivity is always stable. The long battery life is also a strong point. Nothing shocking but they certainly represent a convenient purchase for those without high budgets. ;1
310; Excellent value for money; I must admit that these headphones guarantee superior performance compared to the low cost. The sound is clear and full-bodied, while the workmanship is robust. The battery life is also exceptional . Definitely among the best quality -price ratios I have found;1
311;They seem good at first but then...; These headphones seem good at first but then they start to give problems, such as a drop in audio power or interference. Unfortunately, their durability is not up to par and after a short time they are already inefficient . Clearly not reliable in the medium to long term;1
312;Bluetooth headset; These Bluetooth headphones discreetly carry out their wireless playback task, guaranteeing the promised service in terms of autonomy and connectivity . Nothing sensational but they still represent an honest choice for those who are not looking for advanced functions.;1
313;Only high frequencies!!!; I must admit that these headphones only reproduce the high frequencies well, while they are completely insufficient in the bass, resulting in a faded and monotonous sound. Certainly not suitable for many musical genres due to this important lack;1
314;The right stopped working after 2 times; Unfortunately, after just a few uses the right earphone stopped working correctly, a sign of poor construction quality. An early defect that affects its reliability in the medium to long term. It is difficult to consider them as a lasting investment;1
315;Returned after a week due to malfunction; I was forced to return these headphones after less than a week due to numerous malfunctions that made them effectively unusable. Clearly faulty and unreliable. I will definitely choose a more solid brand next time;1
316;Bad purchase; Unfortunately I have to reject this purchase, disappointed by the very poor quality of these headphones. The sound is flat and metallic, completely devoid of detail. Additionally, after a few weeks of use, both earbuds stopped working properly. A defective product that I absolutely cannot recommend;1
317;Bad quality; The audio quality of these headphones is decidedly low, with a ringing and metallic sound that makes listening to music unpleasant. Even being held in the ears after a short time is uncomfortable . Surely you can find better products at this price.;1
318;What a disappointment; Unfortunately these headphones totally disappointed me. After a few weeks one of the earbuds stopped working and the overall sound was flat and lacking in detail. Nothing that justifies the expense made. Torner is on this model;1

320;X listening to music is great; To listen to music and podcasts these headphones do their job discreetly. The sound is balanced and the battery lasts a long time. Nothing superlative but for occasional use they are fine.;1
321;Short life; Unfortunately these headphones have proven to have a very short useful life. After just two months of use one of the earphones stopped working properly. Too much money spent for such a limited duration of time;1
322;Volume level.;The maximum volume that these headphones can reach is too low and does not allow you to adequately enjoy music in noisy environments. Even when you raise your voice to the maximum, it remains muffled without the right power;1
323;Not connectable to Huawei tablets.;Unfortunately these headphones were not compatible with my Huawei tablet, as they were unable to connect correctly. A defect that made it useless to use, forcing me to return it;1
324;Wrong purchase.; Unfortunately I have to admit that these headphones turned out to be a bad purchase. The sound is completely flat and inaccurate, while the seal in the ears is uncomfortable . Nothing worthwhile at this price, better to spend a little more ;1
325;Good purchase for what it's worth; Considering the very low price at which they were purchased, these headphones do their job discreetly. The sound is average and the battery lasts a long time. Nothing exceptional but they represent a good quality / price ratio;1
326; The battery is excellent, the sound is less; I must admit that the battery life is excellent , allowing me to use them for hours without needing to be recharged. Unfortunately the sound is flat and lacking in bass, disappointing me in this respect.;1
327;Not recommended !!!; I strongly advise against these headphones, I was disappointed by the poor sound quality, seriously lacking especially in the bass. Furthermore, after a few months of use, the Bluetooth connection became unstable;1
328;Avoidable; These headphones should have been avoided, I would have taken refuge in better alternatives. The sound is narrow and flat, while the seal in the ears after a short time is uncomfortable. Nothing that justifies the expense;1
329; Very low quality; The audio quality of these headphones is really very low, with a metallic and indistinct sound, devoid of any detail. The construction doesn't seem to be the most solid either. Impossible to recommend them at this price;1
330;Not working; Unfortunately, since purchase, one of the earpieces of these headphones has never been found to work. Evidently it was a defective product that I had to return. Too bad because the design seemed comfortable;1
331;Very bad... Acceptable sound but...; Unfortunately I have to say that these headphones turned out to be terrible. Of course, the sound is reasonably clear but they are too rigid and generate annoying pain after a short while. Also, after 2 months the earphones lose power. I don't recommend them;1
332;They are short. Muddy and closed audio.; These headphones totally disappoint the expectations of immersive sound. In fact, the bass is confused and the audio in general is too closed. The construction quality is also not excellent . Very low quality / price ratio;1
333;Good but not for racing; Overall, these headphones have proven to be valid for listening to music during sedentary activities. Unfortunately, however, they are unstable and uncomfortable during the race, constantly slipping. Not suitable for intensive sports practice;1
334;After six months it no longer works; I was disappointed by these headphones whose battery stopped charging after just 6 months of use, making them useless. Too little for the value spent. I would have liked greater longevity . I don't recommend them;1
335;Good; I must say that these headphones have given me good satisfaction by offering an excellent quality -price ratio. Very light, comfortable and with a balanced sound. Nothing extraordinary but overall they represent an excellent low cost solution;1
336; Convenient, easy to use and good battery; These headphones have proven to be very comfortable and practical to use thanks also to excellent battery life. They also ensure good sound for the price range. Definitely a buyer to be evaluated positively.;1

338;A disappointment. After a month they no longer charge; Unfortunately these headphones did not meet my expectations. In fact, after just a month, the battery was irremediably damaged, no longer allowing it to be recharged . Disappointing for the price paid, I expected longer life;1
339;To be tested; Since it is a product yet to be tested I cannot express myself adequately. However, the construction does not seem excellent and some reviews complain of defects. I will evaluate the use before making a final opinion.;1
340;Chinoiserie;" Unfortunately I have to say that these cheap headphones turned out to be of the lowest  ""Chinoiserie"""". Finely they get ruined after very few uses demonstrating very poor quality . Better to spend a little more and avoid similar purchases""";1
341;Right headset does not recharge; Too bad, after just 2 months the right earpiece of these headphones completely stopped charging, making them unusable. Clearly a reliability problem is which we do not recommend its use despite the affordable cost.;1
342;Very bad: they do not have the characteristics described.; I was disappointed to find that these headphones do not meet the described characteristics at all. The sound is basic and the comfort is zero. Obvious production problems that will lead to returns;1
343;A good product at an affordable price (as long as it worked); Overall these headphones offered good value for money as long as they worked, which was for around 6 months. Then unfortunately they were irremediably broken. Nothing long-lasting but overall satisfactory;1
344;Discrete but not suitable for racing; I must say that these headphones are discreet for listening to music during static activities. Unfortunately, during the race they tended to move too much, making them uncomfortable and unsafe. Not suitable for dynamic sports;1
345;Finally a pair of Bluetooth headphones that meet my expectations; I finally found some Bluetooth headphones that fully meet my expectations! The sound is full- bodied and clear, the fit is perfect even for hours of training. Plus the battery lasts a very long time. Excellent, I recommend them;1
346;500 mg dosage not true... It's actually 200 mg per capsule; Unfortunately I have to report that the label of this product states a content of 500mg per capsule, when in reality there is only 200mg inside . A certainly misleading indication that does not respect correct information to the consumer. Better to check the real compositions carefully;1
347;Misleading label; I am disappointed by the misleading labeling of this product, which states untrue dosages. As a consumer I have the right to transparent information, this deception undermines trust in the brand. I prefer to focus on articles with honest communication, where there is no risk of deception;1
348;I think it works; This product could certainly work for the declared health purposes, however, in the absence of confirming scientific studies, doubts remain about its actual usefulness . Perhaps it is better to rely on supplements with proven effectiveness demonstrated by research and medical evidence;1
349; Spirulina tablets; These spirulina-based tablets serve me to supplement my diet with useful nutrients. The flavor is not the best but the important thing is the health benefits. I tolerate them well and they do not create unwanted effects. Nothing extraordinary but they represent a valid tool for my balanced eating style;1
350;as I expected; I have to admit that this product lived up to my expectations, providing the promised nutritional benefits without any inconveniences. I find it a quality preparation that respects the description. Definitely a purchase that I recommend;1
351;Too early; Unfortunately, it is still early to be able to verify the actual effectiveness of this product, after only a few weeks of use. Certainly the active ingredients seem valid but only prolonged use will be able to confirm whether it really produces the advertised results. I am waiting for feedback;1
352;Good but not for me; I must admit that this product has interesting nutritional principles but personally it did not completely convince me in various aspects, such as the flavour. It is probably more suitable for others, while I will try similar alternatives . However, it remains an honest choice;1
353;Salts the appetite; I must give credit to this product for having actually worked in calming the sense of hunger and making me fuller for longer. Excellent as a supplement during a weight loss diet, especially if associated with a balanced eating style. It certainly represents a valid solution;1
354;Good product.; This food supplement has proven to be a good choice, guaranteeing the nutritional elements indicated on the label without any inconveniences. Nothing special but it responds correctly to its functions, therefore representing a valid product in relation to the price;1
355;Tasteless; Unfortunately I have to admit that this product has a very unpleasant taste which makes it difficult to take. It would certainly have required an intervention to make it more pleasant without compromising the ingredients. A limit that affects its use;1
356;No indication for use; I am disappointed by the absolute lack of precise instructions on the use of this product. As a consumer I have the right to clear information, however nothing is said about quantities , intake times, etc. A decidedly lacking aspect which invalidates the conscious choice.;1
357;Fitness elastic bands; These bands are great for my workouts, resistant and comfortable. The various resistance levels make them suitable for all muscles. Lightweight and compact to always carry with you during free body exercises on the go. Nothing special but they work well.;1
358;Disappointed poor quality and durability; Unfortunately I have to note that these elastics do not respect the long-lasting promise, after a very short time of use they have already given in and are ruined . Clearly a sign of poor quality is the materials which do not make them reliable over time. Better to choose more resistant products ;1
359;Random sizes; A big problem with this garment is the total randomness of the sizes indicated, which do not correspond at all to the standard measurements. Probably a packaging defect that makes the choice random and can lead to waste. This important peculiarity certainly should have been better controlled � ;1
360;Recalled product tested and returned; I tried this product for a few days and it was satisfactory but then, due to a change of supplier, the integration was suddenly withdrawn from the market. A shame because it seemed valid, but I understand industrial dynamics can determine these eventualities;1
361;I wouldn't buy it again; These headphones disappointed me, especially with the poor battery life. After just a week of use the earphones stopped charging properly forcing me to replace them. I would have liked greater reliability given the price, which is why I wouldn't buy them again;1
362;Everything good but low sound quality; The sound of these headphones is discreet , with full-bodied bass and balanced mids. Unfortunately the highs are sometimes excessively accentuated to the point of being strident. Furthermore, the build quality doesn't seem to be the best. Nothing important but something more I would have expected. ;1
363;There is no need to recharge them or connect them to the device; These headphones have proven to be very comfortable thanks to the convenience of never having to recharge them or connect them to the device. Just take them out of the case and they are already working. Unfortunately, however, the sound remains rather sparse and poor in detail.;1
364;They last a week;Unfortunately the poor battery life of these headphones, which last just a week, makes them impractical. I am often forced to charge them, effectively nullifying their ease of use. A shame because otherwise I was fond of it;1
365;Earphone covers;The earphone covers were found to be too soft, tending to deform easily with daily use and lose the secure fit in the ears. A significant detail that affects its use over time.;1
366;Good value for money; These headphones offer good value for money . The sound is discreet and balanced, while the fit is It is also comfortable for intense workouts. The battery also lasts a long time. Nothing shocking but they represent an honest purchase;1
367;They do not deserve praise. Low perceived quality. High price; Unfortunately for the performance and quality revealed , the price of these headphones seems excessive to me. The sound is flat and lacking in detail, while the seal quickly proves uncomfortable. Nothing that justifies the expense made.;1
368; 👌 They are recognized without problems by 📱 iphone 12 pro and 📱 xs max; I was pleasantly surprised by the full compatibility of these headphones with my Apple devices, with a stable and fast connection. A point in their favor in a price range where it is not always a given;1
369;No compatibility problems with iPhone 11;Connecting them to my iPhone 11 I did not encounter any problems with recognition or stability of the Bluetooth connection. An important aspect that makes these headphones reliable.;1
370; Good bass and mids. Highs can be improved. An excellent alternative to the originals. I'll tell you why..; The sound of these headphones is full-bodied , with powerful bass and balanced mids. Unfortunately the highs are sometimes blurry. However, considering the lower price compared to the originals, they still represent an excellent compromise for quality listening . ;1
371;Good cover but with some flaws;The earphone cover turned out to be well made but with some details that could be improved. For example, it tends to get dirty easily and the opening system is not the most intuitive . Nothing serious but small defects on an otherwise good product;1
372;I thought it was top but...; I really thought I had found a top of the line set of headphones at an affordable price. Unfortunately the sound is lacking in detail and the seal was uncomfortable after a short time, falling short of expectations. ;1
373;Bad freebuds pro cover!; This cover proved to be totally unsuitable for protecting and carrying the earphones. The mechanism does not close securely and tends to get dirty quickly. Absolutely not to purchase given the poor workmanship;1
374;Does not suck ANYTHING; Unfortunately, these headphones do not isolate external noise at all, making satisfying listening difficult in crowded or noisy environments. A serious flaw that actually compromises its use in many circumstances;1
375;In short; Ultimately these headphones do their job discreetly but do not excel in anything that can be fully recommended. The sound is average as is the fit . Nothing exciting;1
376;Useful outside the home but…; These headphones have proven to be useful when away from home thanks to the convenience of Bluetooth. Unfortunately, the sound is flat and after a few months the battery has drastically reduced. Nothing long-lasting, I don't consider them a good investment;1

380;Poor product; Unfortunately I have to say that these headphones fully reflect the poor quality of the materials. In fact, after just a few uses the earphones started to noticeably deteriorate. Product not to be purchased at all;1
381;Are we kidding??; I was honestly amazed by these headphones which, in addition to being aesthetically pleasing, gave off a thunderous and distorted sound. Can we really argue that they are marketable? I certainly expected more for the price paid;1
382;An excellent gift idea for this Christmas.; I believe these headphones could represent an excellent gift idea for the holidays thanks to their minimal and elegant design. They also ensure discreet music listening on the move at a price accessible to all. Advised! ;1
383;I don't recommend them; I strongly advise against purchasing these headphones as they are uncomfortable and noisy, as well as of very poor quality . After a few uses the earphones were already defective. Better to spend slightly more for more reliable products;1
384;VERY DISAPPOINTING; Unfortunately I have to consider these headphones a total disappointment. The sound is crackly and distorted, the earphones are stiff and uncomfortable. Furthermore, after less than a month they were irremediably broken. Completely unsuitable for the purpose;1
385;good for the price; Overall these headphones have proven to be valid considering the low price. Nothing exceptional obviously but they allow you to listen to music or podcasts on the move without great demands. However, they represent an excellent economic solution;1
386;A scam; I was disappointed to find that these headphones were nothing more than a scam. In fact, the sound was non-existent and the Bluetooth connection was completely absent. I expected them to work at least...;1
387;very bad.sound and earphones; Unfortunately these headphones turned out to be terrible in every respect. Both the sound, crackling and distorted, and the earphones, which are far too rigid, are of very low quality . Absolutely wasted money, I do not recommend the purchase;1
388;Unstable connection; The Bluetooth connection of these headphones proved to be decidedly unstable and discontinuous, with frequent interruptions in the sound even a few meters away. A defect that totally compromises its use, especially during physical activity;1

390; bluetooth headphones; Also considering the affordable cost, these headphones proved to be a good solution. Very light and with a balanced sound, they allow you to fully enjoy music or chat on the move . Nothing too sophisticated but functional for the purpose;1
391;Returned 15 min later; Unfortunately I had to return these headphones just 15 minutes after purchasing them as they were already defective . In fact the left earphone did not emit any sound correctly. Clearly an unreliable product that had malfunctions from the start. I was right to request the return immediately;1
392;Surprise!!!!!!!; I must admit that these headphones positively surprised me! They guarantee clear, full-bodied sound, with powerful bass. Bluetooth connectivity is also always optimal. Nothing to say other than praise, they undoubtedly represent excellent value for money . Strongly recommended;1
393;Only the Right or Left does not go in stereo; Unfortunately I found that these headphones are not able to reproduce music in stereo mode, but either only the right earphone or the left one. Definitely a significant flaw that affects the sonic fidelity. Clearly not suitable for those who like to listen in detail;1
394;Very functional. But How does the charging case work?; These headphones seem valid but I remain perplexed about the actual charging capacity of the case. In fact, it is not clear whether the latter also needs to be recharged or whether it is autonomous. Information that is not exhaustive and does not fully clarify how it works;1
395;Left earphone not working; Unfortunately I have to note that from the first use the left earphone stopped working correctly, a sign of an obvious manufacturing defect. A serious problem that immediately affects regular use. It clearly derives from poor quality controls � ;1

399;Improve Bluetooth connection and repeat audio and very acceptable; These headphones certainly have room for improvement, such as Bluetooth connectivity not always instantaneous and the quality of telephone audio . However, overall they perform their function well, especially for listening to music. They represent a good compromise considering the price;1
400; Smart working; These practical headphones have proven to be the ideal companion for my smart working, guaranteeing clear calls and a pleasant background soundtrack. Very light and comfortable even for hours of continuous use. Definitely recommended for agile productivity ;1
401;Good but uncomfortable...; I must admit that these headphones sound good but the design is not the most comfortable , becoming a little narrow and annoying after a short time. For long periods a more ergonomic model would be better . Nothing serious but some improvements would be appreciated;1

406; NOT compatible with Fiat Punto Evo; Unfortunately these bulbs were not compatible with my Fiat Punto Evo, as they did not adapt correctly to the headlight. A shame given that they seemed excellent, but it is important to always check compatibility with your vehicle before purchasing;1
407;LED lamps with cooling fan; These LED bulbs with built-in cooling fan have proven to be an excellent purchase. The light beam is very powerful and homogeneous, allowing me to drive safely even at night. The fan also keeps temperatures low, preventing overheating;1
408;Product below expectations.; I have to admit I was disappointed with these bulbs. Despite the cooling fan, during prolonged use the light tends to dim until it almost turns off. Clearly not up to the price paid. I would have liked more reliability � ;1
409; Of little importance; Unfortunately, after just a few months these bulbs started to lose light power, proving to be of little value. For the limited use I make of it, it would have been better to opt for cheaper products. Nothing exciting;1
410; car lights h7; These LED bulbs are perfect for replacing the headlights of my car with H7 lamps. The light beam is white and very bright, giving great visibility even at night. It turned out to be an excellent purchase;1
411; Excellent for high beams; Installed on the high beam headlights of my car, these bulbs turned out to be perfect. Providing an intense white light, they significantly improve visibility without dazzling other motorists. Also equipped with a long life;1

413;adapters that do not fit; The adapters supplied with these bulbs did not prove adequate for my headlight, not anchoring securely. A problem that made it useless, forcing me to replace it. Better to check compatibility carefully � ;1
414; Fitted on Benelli Trk502x; Installed on the headlights of my Benelli Trk502x, these LED bulbs proved to be excellent. They provide a powerful, white light beam, significantly improving night visibility . They turned out to be perfect for my bike;1

420;Excellent bulbs even if the fan...; I can confirm that these bulbs are excellent in terms of power and light intensity. Perhaps the only flaw is the excessive noise of the cooling fan, which disturbs driving at night a bit. Nothing compromising anyway;1
421;They only work without CAN bus - Spectacular light!; These LED bulbs work very well ensuring optimal vision, unfortunately it is only by deactivating the standard CAN-bus system that makes them discontinuous. A shame, it would have been better to find a more stable technical solution;1
422;Problem switching from halogen to LED, the workshop didn't fit them for me; Unfortunately I had problems replacing the bulbs, as my workshop was unable to correctly install LEDs instead of the standard halogens. A service that should be improved to fully satisfy the customer;1
423; Powerful and very clear light, easy installation; I must say that these bulbs proved to be excellent thanks to a powerful and defined light. Furthermore, they are easy to assemble even for novice users. They certainly represent an excellent investment;1
424; Excellent product from a hardware point of view, pay attention to the size of the fan; Overall these bulbs offer quality lighting at an average price. Unfortunately, however, the size of the cooling fan is excessive on some models. Pay attention to compatibility when purchasing;1
425; Higher brightness but they are NOT APPROVED; I must admit that these bulbs guarantee significantly higher brightness but unfortunately they are not approved for road circulation. A limitation that certainly precludes widespread use, which is a shame;1
426; High construction quality and innovative and more effective LED arrangement; These bulbs are equipped with LEDs arranged in an innovative way which significantly improves the light output compared to classic models. The construction quality is also excellent . They undoubtedly represent a notable step forward;1
427;"They appear well made and simple to assemble but they are ""outlawed""!"; Unfortunately I must point out that, despite the excellent workmanship, these bulbs are not compliant with the law. A serious limitation that actually advises against their use on the road to those who care about formal correctness.;1
428;Nothing to do with old halogen bulbs; Compared to classic halogen bulbs, these LEDs offer a completely different level of light: more powerful , white and natural. A huge leap in quality which significantly improves night visibility ;1
429; Good light intensity to check the duration m time; So far these bulbs are giving me good satisfaction, although I'm waiting to check their stability over time. The light is intense and well balanced. Nothing exceptional but if they last they will prove to be excellent;1

432;A beautiful light; I must say that these bulbs really emit a beautiful, white and natural light. Furthermore, the directional beam significantly improves visibility compared to classic models. Excellent investment;1
433;Clear and sharp vision; So far these bulbs are giving me clearer, sharper night vision than ever before. Nothing to say about the power of the light emitted, perfectly balanced. Excellent purchase;1
434; EXCELLENT KIT AND NICE BEAM OF LIGHT... NORMAL PRICE; Overall, these bulbs offer good quality materials, assembly and light output, all at a price in line with expectations. Nothing sensational but they represent an excellent low-cost solution;1

Excellent product that I will definitely recommend � ;1

I really appreciate that they don't use CanBus communication, as they can also be installed on older cars. Nothing to object other than compliments, they clearly represent a winning choice;1
437;They get far and don't have much longevity.; These lamps can illuminate a large area well without problems, however their durability over time is not the best. After a few months they started to flicker and then stopped completely. Unfortunately the durability is too limited which makes the purchase worthless;1
438;Nice product; I must admit that this product actually proved to be beautiful and well made. Nothing to say about its aesthetics and general workmanship. However, only prolonged use will be able to confirm whether it will keep its qualitative promises even in the medium-long term. For now the impressions are good;1
439;A 2021 LED headlight in a 2012 car; These lamps turned out to be a little too modern and high-performance for my dated car, in fact they created some interference with the other electrical devices. Perhaps it would have been better to choose a more basic model. Nothing serious but not perfectly compatible. ;1
440; Purchase Not Recommended; Unfortunately I must strongly advise against the purchase of this product, which has proven to be lacking in all respects. From the first uses it gave rise to numerous problems which compromised all its functionality . Money really badly spent;1
441; Dirt from the worst China; Honestly, these lamps refer to the worst Asian production in terms of materials and workmanship. After a very short time they deteriorated noticeably. Absolutely not recommended for those who want a minimum of quality and reliability ;1
442;Disappointing purchase. Requested refund.; I remain disappointed with this purchase which did not meet expectations. In addition to the price being too high, the lamps failed in a short time. I had to request a refund, evidently they did not represent a safe investment;1
443;I doubt the reliability of these masks.; I have strong doubts about the real protective efficacy of these masks given the limited information provided. In such a delicate moment it is essential to rely on PPE certified and tested according to rigorous standards. Better to focus on more transparent brands ;1

Poor materials and precarious functionality. A real shame because I thought it was reliable. I remain dissatisfied;1

451;Disappointing purchase; Unfortunately these masks turned out to be a real disappointment. The elastics were already damaged and badly cut and after a few uses they came off completely, making them unusable. For the price paid I would have expected much higher quality and durability;1
452;Bad purchase; I have to see this purchase as a real mistake. The masks that arrived had visible defects already in the packaging, with torn elastic bands and holed fabric. Absolutely lacking, I can only advise against purchasing it;1
453; Italian product to be verified for suitability; Before proceeding with the purchase of these masks I should have checked the certified quality of the product more carefully. Unfortunately, the elastics were ruined after just a few uses, effectively rendering them unusable.;1
454;1/3 of the masks were broken.; The delivery of these masks turned out to be terrible, with even a third of the pieces inside the box damaged or with the elastics already broken . A service that did not meet my expectations;1

456;Masks with holes; After just a week of use, these masks already had holes in the fabric, effectively nullifying their use. A manufacturing defect that compromised its reliability . I will remain skeptical about this brand. ;1
457;THE USUAL ITALIAN RIP-OFF; Unfortunately, these masks also turned out to be defective, with poorly made elastics that tend to tear. Low quality products that disappoint expectations, confirming some Italian biases;1
458;Good masks and good value for money.; These masks live up to their promises by offering good comfort at an affordable price. The fabric is breathable and the elastics are well fixed. They certainly represent a valid purchase for daily use;1
459;Comfortable, not bad!; I must admit that these masks have proven to be comfortable to wear thanks to the soft elastic bands that adhere well to the face. The breathable fabric makes them pleasant even for prolonged use. Nothing exceptional but honest;1
460; Safe Masks; I have to praise these masks for their solid construction and safety. The filter fabric is thick and well sewn to the elastics, which show no signs of sagging. Definitely a reliable product over time;1
461;Nice product although not cheap but the elastics are too short!;These masks perform their filtering job discreetly, with good adhesion to the face. Unfortunately the elastics are too short for my head, forcing me to tie them up. Nothing compromising but a few more cm would have been helpful;1
462;Bad yet another mask with detached elastics.; Once again I was disappointed with the seal of these masks. After a few uses the elastics came off, making them useless. Too many defects in products that should guarantee protection;1
463;size;These masks proved to be too large for my face, leaving uncovered side spaces. I would have appreciated tighter sizes in order to guarantee a perfect fit . ;1
464;They look good but the elastic is tight;The mask itself seems well made but unfortunately the elastics are so tight that they are annoying to the ears after little use. A shame because the filter is thick and breathable;1
465;Too big and remain too loose;Unfortunately these masks do not fit me well due to their excessive size. They remain loose around the face, effectively nullifying the protection. I should have chosen a tighter size;1
466;They pull on the ears; Unfortunately I must say that these headphones are decidedly uncomfortable to wear for long periods as they tend to pull excessively on the ears, causing discomfort. Too bad, I was hoping for a better fit for the price range;1
467;There is no glue on the rubber bands; I was disappointed to find that the elastics of these headphones were not fixed with glue, constantly slipping on the head. A production defect that effectively invalidates its use. Better, more refined products ;1
468; LOWER QUALITY LEVEL; Unfortunately, these headphones show a clear drop in quality compared to the past. In fact, the earphones are fragile and the elastic bands tend to break after a few uses. Too bad, I expected longer duration;1
469;not suitable for adults; I have to admit that these headphones proved too small and narrow for my adult ears. A real shame because the sound is good , but the fit is not suitable for everyone. Better to check the measurements before purchasing;1
470;A little small; Overall these headphones offer a decent quality -price ratio but I must point out that their size is slightly small for my ears. Nothing compromising but needs improvement;1
471;Disappointment; Unfortunately I was disappointed by these headphones which, in addition to having a mediocre sound, after a few uses they started to lose power and turned off. Completely unreliable for long durations;1
472;Very bad to avoid; I completely advise against purchasing these headphones, as they have a crackling and distorted sound even at low volume. Furthermore, after just a week the earphones lost connection. Definitely poor product;1
473; Purchase strongly not recommended; Unfortunately I have to advise against this purchase as the headphones, in addition to being noisy and not very ergonomic, showed serious malfunctions after a few days. Absolutely wasted money, there are better options;1
474;not really satisfied...; Overall these headphones turned out to be average but I must admit that I am not completely satisfied with them. In fact, the sound is barely discreet and the earphones have a poor fit . Nothing sensational in short.;1
475;Good product; So far these headphones are giving me good satisfaction thanks to an excellent quality -price ratio. The earphones guarantee effective isolation and the sound is clear . Nothing exceptional but they represent a valid purchase;1
476;But before selling them did they try to wear them?; I am amazed to see that these headphones, which were uncomfortable to wear, were actually put on the market. They should have tested them first, to offer truly functional products at the requested price;1
477;The strap often comes off; Unfortunately, after a few uses the elastics of these headphones began to noticeably unfasten, no longer keeping the earphones secure. A quality defect makes them effectively unusable;1
478;ffp2 masks; These ffp2 masks have perfectly fulfilled their protective role, guaranteeing comfortable and safe use. Nothing to say other than an excellent purchase given the needs of the period. Recommended;1
479;ffp2 masks; Overall, these masks have proven to be valid, adhering well to the face without creating discomfort even during prolonged use. Nothing extraordinary but they effectively fulfill the filtering purpose. Good quality -price ratio;1
480; Excellent but short elastics.; Overall, these ffp2 masks offer excellent adhesion and filtering effectiveness. Unfortunately, the elastics are slightly short for my size, risking leaving open spaces. Too bad, otherwise perfect;1
481;FFP2 mask incorrect quantity, unsatisfactory quality; Unfortunately this pack of FFP2 masks proved to be disappointing in several respects. First of all, the declared quantity did not correspond, furthermore the level of protection seems to me to be lower than what was indicated. A product that does not conform to expectations which could have guaranteed better quality ;1
482;Good but light; These masks guarantee an excellent fit and adherence to the face but unfortunately they are too light, so much so that they are transparent and not effective in protecting. Perhaps sturdier materials would have made them more reliable also considering the price;1
483;Safe FFP2 masks; I must admit that these FFP2 masks have proven to be perfectly safe and certified. They offer a comfortable fit ensuring a high barrier. Definitely recommended for those who want maximum personal protection and towards others in this difficult period.;1
484;Disappointed; I am disappointed by this pack of masks which has failed to live up to its promises. As soon as it was opened, packaging defects were noticed which cast doubt on its sterility . Furthermore, the filtering level seemed inadequate to me. Unfortunately wasted money;1
485; damaged packaging, 4 masks missing; This package of FFP2 masks arrived with obvious signs of damage that cast doubt on its integrity . Furthermore, 4 pieces are missing inside despite the quantity indicated. Clearly a non-compliant and unreliable product;1
486; Size not suitable for adults; Unfortunately I have to note that the measurements of these masks are not suitable for an adult audience but rather for children, resulting very narrow and uncomfortable for those with a wider face . A serious design flaw that greatly limits its usefulness is 1;1
487;Excellent product but...; Overall, these masks guarantee good protection and the quality -price ratio is excellent , however I found that after a few hours of use they tend to tear easily at the headband. A resistance problem that could be improved;1
488;Too big.....; I must admit that these masks are really too big for my face, so much so that they are uncomfortable and flattering. It probably would have been better to have different sizes to fit all faces. For me they are not functional at all;1
489;good product; I must admit that these masks represent a good product, with excellent filtering properties in relation to the cost. The fit is It is comfortable and I have not found any defects. Nothing sensational but certainly valid for the required daily use;1
490;BAD PRODUCT; Unfortunately, these masks have proven to be completely unsuitable for use, so much so that they are practically useless. Besides poor adhesion, I doubt they offer a real protective barrier. Absolutely to avoid if you are looking for maximum security;1
491;Very good but count the masks; These masks have proven to be excellent from all points of view but be careful to check the pieces of the package which in some cases are missing. Better to make sure you have the actual quantity before completing the purchase;1
492;Too narrow; Unfortunately I must point out that these masks are far too tight and tight, so much so that they are uncomfortable even for just a few minutes. My face is probably wider than the standard size. Too bad, it would have been better to have larger sizes;1
493;Not satisfied; I remain dissatisfied with these masks which, in addition to being comfortable, I doubt provide an effective protective barrier compared to better models. Perhaps the too low price has affected the overall quality. Better to spend a little more ;1
494; Satisfactory product even if it arrived in a broken box.; Despite the box being damaged upon arrival, I must admit that these masks perform their function well. Nothing special but they are reliable and economical, therefore they represent a good compromise also considering the price;1
495; excellent but the elastic comes off almost immediately; Unfortunately I have found that these masks, although excellent in fit , however have a big problem in the retaining elastic which tends to come off after very few uses. Clearly an important lack that compromises its effective duration;1
496;I do not recommend purchasing; Unfortunately I must strongly advise against purchasing these masks. The elastics tend to give out easily after a few uses and are also so short that they do not adapt well to most adult faces. A clearly defective product;1
497;Rubber bands are terrible. They are narrow. The underwire hurts! For children or very thin faces; These masks turned out to be totally unsuitable for my face. The elastic bands exert an annoying and unnatural pressure, forcing me to remove them after a short while. The underwire also stings. Definitely purchasable only for small children;1
498;incorrect description; Unfortunately, the description of these masks on the sales site was misleading. The elastics are actually extremely short and not suitable for most adults. An important detail not properly specified;1
499;Unusable product incredibly short elastics. You can't sell a product like this.; I was very disappointed by these practically unusable masks. The elastics are ridiculously short and do not stretch in any way, not fitting any face. A malfunctioning product that did not deserve to be sold. ;1
500;Doubt about CE certification. Light..; When purchasing these masks I had doubts about the real certification. In fact, the filter appears thin and porous, probably not capable of filtering adequately. It is important to always check supporting documentation;1
501;Safe masks; I must admit that these masks seem well made and guarantee a good fit thanks to the adjustable elastic bands. The filter fabric appears thick and breathable. Definitely a reliable product;1
502;I thought better...; Unfortunately these masks failed to meet my expectations. The elastics are far too short even for a small face like mine. I would have liked greater adaptability to the various conformations. ;1
503;Not among the best; These masks do their job in an average manner but nothing more . The filter fabric is thin and the elastics tend to overtighten the ears after a short while. Better products can be found;1
504;Too bad they're all damaged; I was disappointed to receive the entire package of damaged masks, with already threadbare elastics and fabric. Probably the fault of the transport but it completely ruined the purchase;1
505;They are not suitable for wearing by an adult; Unfortunately I realized that these masks are totally unsuitable for my face as an adult man. The elastics are too short and tighten the ears excessively, making them uncomfortable even after a few minutes;1
506;Elastics give way easily; After a few washes, the elastics of these masks began to give way, stretching dangerously. A sealing defect over time that compromises its use, given the safety function;1
507;Good product; I must admit that these masks guarantee a good fit and protection thanks to the breathable but thick fabric. The elastics are also resistant and do not tighten excessively. Overall a solid purchase.;1
508;They do what they promise; These masks live up to their promises by providing a good protective barrier. The fabric proved to be breathable even after hours of use and the fit was excellent It is optimal . Nothing to object to quality and comfort;1
509;Quality but shipping more expensive than expected; These masks seemed excellent to me but unfortunately I had to pay much more for transport than initially expected. A surcharge that penalized the purchase a bit;1
510;Elastics too short!; Unfortunately the elastics on these masks are too short to fit my face properly. Remaining wide at the sides, they do not guarantee adequate protection. I would have liked more complete sizes;1
511;Practical and comfortable; These masks have proven to be practical and comfortable to wear thanks also to the adjustable straps. They ensure a good adhesion to the face while not being too tight. Nothing exceptional but they represent an excellent low cost purchase;1
512;Bad packaging; Unfortunately I must point out that these masks arrived in a package without any hermetic seal. A serious defect that compromises its hygiene and durability over time. Better, more refined products ;1
513;Very scarce; These masks proved to be very poor, especially in terms of adhering to the face. In fact, they tended to continually rise, not ensuring effective protection. Absolutely avoid. ;1
514;TWO MASKS WERE MISSING; I was disappointed to find that two masks were missing from the package ordered. Obvious packaging problems that could compromise the protection of doctors or nurses. Brand to be wary of;1
515;Good masks but the laces are TOO TIGHT; Overall, these masks offer a good fit - unfortunately - the elastic bands are excessively tight and annoying to wear for long periods. Nothing compromising anyway;1
516; the laces on the right are longer and less elastic than those on the left; I must point out a slight asymmetry regarding the elastics of these masks, with the right one being longer and less flexible. Nothing serious but needs improvement in terms of product accuracy;1
517; Defective product; Unfortunately these masks arrived defective, with the elastic bands completely broken. Of course they are not usable. A big shame for an essential product like this;1
518;PROBLEM WITH ELASTICS; I was disappointed to see after a few uses that the elastics of these masks began to break, compromising their use. Clearly quality defects make it inadvisable to purchase;1
519;Narrow; I must admit that these masks are really too tight and annoying to wear, especially for prolonged use. A serious limitation that actually compromises comfort;1
520;The rubber bands break; Unfortunately I have found that the elastics on these masks tend to break quickly after a few weeks of regular use. A construction defect that affects its reliability over time.;1
521;Disappointing last purchase; I have to say that this latest purchase totally disappointed me. In fact, the masks arrived without the necessary health certification. Waste of money, to be absolutely avoided;1
522;Bad quality solos not recommended; Unfortunately these masks turned out to be of very poor quality from every point of view. In addition to being uncomfortable, after a few uses they had noticeable tears. Totally wasted money, not recommended. ;1
523; the certifying body is not in the NANDO register; I remain perplexed by the fact that these masks report certification bodies that cannot be found in the official registers. An obvious attempt at deception which completely advises against purchasing it in favor of more transparent brands;1
524;Bad product; Unfortunately I have to say that these masks proved to be completely unsuitable for use. In fact, the elastics were too short and frayed, without providing any seal. Product to be totally avoided;1
525;Not recommended, many are defective; I strongly advise against these masks because , as reported by numerous reviews, they often arrive defective with broken laces or other problems. Better to opt for brands that are more accurate in production;1
526;Excellent quality to buy on promotion as it is a little expensive but you know you pay for a good product.; These masks convinced me thanks to the excellent quality of the materials and the perfect fit . Of course the price is higher , but they represent an investment over time. Recommended especially if on promotion, a good compromise between expense and protection. Definitely reliable;1
527; excellent and resistant; I must admit that these headphones are truly excellent from every point of view. The resistant design ensures excellent durability , while the full-bodied sound fully satisfies. Nothing to complain about, other than praise, they clearly represent an excellent purchase! ;1
528;I thought I was making an excellent purchase; Unfortunately I have to note that these headphones have unfortunately disappointed expectations. Already at the first uses, annoying connection problems and audio losses appeared. Money wasted on an unreliable product;1
529;Not satisfied. 4 Layers. Not 5.; I was very disappointed to learn that the masks received actually only have 4 internal layers advertised, not the 5 advertised. A non-trivial information flaw that implicitly reduces protection;1
530;Short elastics; Unfortunately these headphones have elastic bands that are too short, so much so that they are uncomfortable and flattering on my face. Universal sizes capable of adapting to all shapes probably needed to be studied;1
531;They work; I must admit that these masks perform their primary function as a filter barrier well, being comfortable to wear thanks also to the adjustable elastic bands. Nothing exceptional but they represent reliable products;1
532;After just one day it no longer works; I am disappointed with these headphones which stopped working properly after just 1 day of use. Clearly an unacceptable manufacturing defect which demonstrates its poor durability ;1
533;It only worked a little over a month; Unfortunately I have to note that these headphones broke down after just over a month, a sign of clearly insufficient quality. Money wasted on a product that doesn't last long enough;1
534; Poor packaging, broken case, good headphones; Despite the damaged packaging upon arrival, I must admit that these headphones have held up. Nothing special but they perform the service well, especially considering the low price;1
535;It broke within a few days; I am disappointed by these headphones which are already broken after just a few days of use. Clearly this is a defective product, built with poor quality material. Even the after-sales service was unable to protect me;1
536;Headphones with cancellation. Noise Control In-Ear Bass with Microphone and Controller (Black); These headphones have shown various limitations. For example, the audio quality is just sufficient and the controls are not very intuitive. I also doubt the real noise canceling capabilities. Not recommended for those looking for high performance.;1
537;Bad product, I don't recommend it; Based on my experience I can only strongly advise against purchasing these headphones. In addition to design flaws, they proved lacking in too many aspects, resulting in them being effectively unusable. Absolutely wasted money;1
538;Poor; I must admit that these headphones have disappointed expectations, proving to be extremely poor in terms of quality. The sound is flat and devoid of details, while the workmanship seems cheap. Nothing justifies the price paid;1
539;Microphone quality is bad; Unfortunately I have to note that the quality of the microphone integrated into the headphones is truly terrible, producing metallic and distorted voices, which are essentially unusable for video calls or important calls. A non-negligible deficit;1
540;Corded headphones sometimes crackle; I appreciate that these headphones are wired but unfortunately they sometimes emit unpleasant crackling noises due to interference, which is annoying when listening to music. Perhaps there was room for improvement;1
541;The electrostimulation of the product is good but the stickers are really lacking;This electrical stimulator has an excellent stimulation intensity, but unfortunately the included stickers come off easily from wet skin after a few uses. A shame because otherwise it would be an excellent purchase, but this defect actually compromises its prolonged use;1
542;It works; I have to admit that this electrical stimulator worked well during my workouts, providing effective muscle stimulation. Nothing to object to the reliability . ;1
543;The price is fine.. but at least the honesty!; Unfortunately, the relatively low price of this stimulator does not coincide with the quality of the product. In fact, the included stickers come off easily making it virtually unusable. I would have appreciated a minimum of transparency on the matter;1
544;I must have been unlucky...; Maybe I was unlucky but this stimulator broke down after just a few uses, ceasing to deliver electricity. An early malfunction that quickly ruined the purchase;1
545;COMPATIBLE; I am satisfied to have verified the full compatibility of this stimulator with my training app. The synchrony is perfect and the stimulation is targeted on the single muscle group. It is important to always ensure compatibility ;1
546;Disappointed; Unfortunately I was disappointed by this stimulator which, despite good initial functioning, stopped providing stimulation after only a couple of weeks of training. Too short a time before failure;1
547;Fast shipping but...; I must praise the speed of shipping but unfortunately this stimulator has shown malfunctions since the beginning, with the intensity of the stimulus not being adjustable. Defective product that cannot be used;1
548;Bad purchase; Unfortunately I have to judge this purchase as a real mistake. The stimulator stopped working after a few workouts and the included stickers were virtually unusable. Nothing in line with expectations;1
549;Excellent; I must admit that this electrical stimulator performs its function very well, providing targeted and intense stimulation. The stickers also adhere perfectly to the skin even when I sweat. Excellent quality -price ratio;1
550;It seems to work; It appears that this stimulator works correctly by delivering stimuli of adjustable intensity. I hope it confirms the good initial impressions over time. I will use it over the next few weeks, monitoring its performance;1
551;Excellent; This electrical stimulator has proven to be excellent in every respect. The stimulation is powerful and targeted, lasting over time thanks to the quality adhesives . Definitely one of the best purchases for my workouts;1
552;Keeps promises; I must admit that this stimulator keeps its promises by providing correct, intense and personalized muscle stimulation. The stickers adhere perfectly. Excellent quality-price ratio . ;1
553; beautiful and functional; This stimulator is aesthetically beautiful and functional during training, delivering targeted electrical stimuli. The stickers stick well to the skin even when I sweat. It undoubtedly represents a valid choice;1
554;Shower suction cup handles; These handles equipped with suction cups have confirmed their effectiveness in improving grip in the shower even when the glass is wet . Solid and well anchored, they make moments of personal hygiene safer .;1
555;Strange effects! I would like to be reassured that it is not harmful; Using this stimulator I have felt some discomfort near my heart that scares me. I contact the manufacturer to make sure that it does not pose health risks, as it acts directly on the nervous system;1
556;Harmful for cats; Unfortunately, this repellent product proved to be harmful to my cat who, after smelling it, started vomiting. Definitely not suitable for pets, I strongly advise against purchasing;1
557;It is ineffective; I must honestly state that this repellent was not effective in keeping unwelcome guests away. Indeed, perhaps it has even increased the influx. Better to opt for tested and certified products;1
558;EXCELLENT BUT DIFFICULT TO KNOW IF IT REALLY WORKS; This repellent seems to have been made with care, however it is difficult to establish its real effectiveness over time. Only experience can confirm its cleaning powers or not. For now I'm waiting for feedback;1
559;Attracts fleas; Unfortunately I have to report that this product attracted even more fleas rather than repelling them . An effect totally opposite to the desired one. Better to avoid it for animal health;1
560;Not long-lasting; I was disappointed by the poor durability of this repellent, the smell of which evaporated after only 2-3 weeks, rendering it ineffective. I would have liked more persistence given the expense;1
561;I advise against.; Unfortunately, I strongly advise against the use of this product as, on my pets, it only caused side effects such as sneezing and conjunctivitis. Its repellent action is doubtful .;1
562;ineffective against ticks; Unfortunately, this product has not proven to be really effective against annoying ticks. Indeed, in some cases it has even attracted others. Better to opt for more certified dermoprophylactic solutions ;1
563;Not even.; I must admit that this repellent, in addition to not having had any cleaning effect, spread a really unpleasant odor in the house. We need to focus on more natural and environmentally friendly products;1
564;Ok; I must say that this repellent has proven itself, effectively fulfilling the purpose of keeping away annoying parasites. Nothing to complain about, it represents an excellent purchase for those who have pets. ;1
565; Quality/price ok; Overall this product offers good value for money . It is certainly not the most powerful repellent on the market but for occasional uses it is more than fine. However, it represents an excellent low cost solution;1
566;Display mug; Unfortunately I have to say that this ceramic mug, in addition to being too small for real use, was ruined after a few uses, chipping on the edge. It seems more suitable for mere exhibition value;1
567;A real rip-off; I was sincerely disappointed by this purchase as the mug, in addition to having an unauthorized character on it, was already fractured upon opening the package. I promptly asked for a refund due to scam;1
568;You can be better; This cup could improve simply by lengthening the handle, which is almost non-existent, forcing uncomfortable carrying with two fingers. A small flaw that affects its practicality is . ;1
569;Unsatisfactory; Unfortunately I have to say that this cup did not satisfy me. In fact, after a few uses the printed decoration began to partially discolour, making the product no longer aesthetically intact . Too bad about the quality � ;1
570;Disney Mickey Mouse mug; This mug depicting Mickey Mouse proved to be delicious and with attention to detail. Ceramic also seems resistant over time. Definitely an excellent gift idea for the little ones . To be recommended;1
571;It looks like a toy; Unfortunately this mug looks like a simple toy. The plastic materials make it seem like a cheap product and not suitable for everyday use. I would have preferred a more solid and resistant workmanship, in line with the price paid. Better to choose more robust items ;1
572;Completely disappointed with the article; I am disappointed by this purchase which did not keep its promises. Since the first wash in the dishwasher, the mug began to lose its design, fading noticeably. Clearly a manufacturing defect that affects its use over time. Wasted money.;1
573;Product not safe!; I strongly advise against this mug, as I have found it leaches chemicals into the hot liquid. A non-negligible aspect that calls into question its safety, especially if intended for food use. Better to opt for healthier materials ;1
574;The graphic part is a warning sticker.; I am perplexed by the fact that the design is made with a simple adhesive rather than with resistant paint. A normal wash is enough to make it partially detach. Little care in the design phase for a product that could have been better;1
575;TO AVOID!; I absolutely do not recommend purchasing this product. In addition to the poor quality of the materials, the sharp edges represent a risk. Better to spend a little more on items without dangers, even more so if intended for children;1
576;Not even.; I have to admit that this mug disappointed me. It proves to be not very resistant after just a few uses and washes. Furthermore, the design tends to fade. There are certainly better alternatives that would guarantee greater durability over time;1
577;Ok; I must admit that this mug fully reflects expectations. The design is resistant and detailed, while the workmanship guarantees solidity . Nothing exceptional but it still represents a valid purchase for its low price;1
578;Quality/price ok; This mug satisfied me, especially considering the purchase price. Certainly nothing extraordinary, but the materials are discreet and the design well printed. Overall it offers a good quality / price ratio which makes it honest;1
579;Display mug; Unfortunately this mug turns out to be too fragile and cheap for everyday use. Better to use it only for display, given its non-resistance to washing which would compromise its decoration over time. I would have preferred more solid materials ;1
580;You can be better; This mug certainly has room for improvement, for example with regards to the graphic definition and the choice of materials. Nothing particularly negative, but probably by investing something more you would have obtained a better performing product;1
581;Unsatisfactory; I remain dissatisfied with this mug which did not keep its promises. The design tends to fade after a few uses and washes. The workmanship also appears fragile. For the price paid we certainly expected more in terms of durability and resistance;1
582;Disney Mickey Mouse Mug; This cute Disney Mickey Mouse mug fully respects the design thanks to a resistant paint. The workmanship also guarantees solidity over time without risk of breakage. Nothing particularly revolutionary but it represents a well-made product suitable for small fans;1
583;It looks like a toy; Unfortunately I have to confirm that this cup looks like a simple toy rather than a product for everyday use. Plastic materials that are too light and thin do not guarantee the required robustness, making it almost seem like a disposable object. I would have preferred better qualities ;1
584;Completely disappointed with the article; I am disappointed with this purchase which is not keeping its promises. After just a few uses the design was practically erased, fading noticeably after the first wash. Clearly workmanship and painting not adequate for the price paid. Money wasted on a poorly made product. ;1
585;Product not safe!; I strongly advise against this cup, as it has sharp and sharp edges which can be dangerous, especially if used by children. Furthermore, the plastic material seems to release substances during contact with hot liquids. Better to choose safer products ;1
586;The graphic part is a warning sticker.; This thermal bottle has graphics which unfortunately turned out to be just a sticker which came off after a few uses. A shame because otherwise it is functional, but I would have appreciated a direct print on the more resistant plastic;1
587;TO AVOID!; I strongly advise against this thermal bottle which, upon first use, started to lose the water contained between the seals. A manufacturing defect that makes it effectively unusable. Wasted money.;1
588;Very functional; I must admit that this thermal bottle has proven to be very practical and functional, maintaining the temperature of the liquid constant for several hours. The measuring rings are precisely adjustable. Nothing to object to quality and performance;1
589; there are adapters for the various threads which is very useful; An excellent feature of this bottle are the adapters for various types of wires included in the package, which increase its adaptability and versatility compared to other models. A useful and well thought out accessory;1
590;Functional; I verified that this thermal bottle does its job correctly, keeping the drink at the desired temperature for a long time. The plastic material seems durable and the compact design makes it convenient to carry;1
591;Consistency; Unfortunately I have to notice a poor consistency of the plastic material this bottle is made of . After a few uses it started to deform and lost its original shape. Nothing that justifies the price;1
592;Poor quality; I was disappointed by the poor build quality of this bottle. After a few weeks of use the plastic started to chip around the spout making it unusable. Defective product;1
593;this is not what was ordered; Unfortunately this bottle does not match the description provided. It was shipped without some accessories indicated during purchase. A service that did not meet my expectations.;1
594;Resistant plastic; I must admit that this bottle is made of impact-resistant and flexible plastic. After months of use it has no scratches or dents. Definitely a quality material � ;1
595;Good but not very good; This bottle does its job discreetly by maintaining the temperature for a long time, however the spout tends to lose its seal after numerous closures. Nothing compromising but some improvements would be appreciated;1
596; Flavored water; I must say that keeping flavored water fresh for a long time in this bottle is really convenient. The flavor remains intense without alterations for hours, hydrating me as best as possible during my walks;1
597;Average rating; Overall this bottle does its job discreetly. Nothing exceptional but at a good price it still represents an honest choice for transporting drinks while keeping them at the right temperature.;1
598; Excellent value for money; This thermal bottle certainly offers an excellent quality -price ratio. The plastic material is durable and constantly maintains the temperature. Nothing to say except that it represents a valid purchase;1
599;RIP-OFF; Unfortunately I have to judge this purchase as a rip-off. The bottle arrived damaged and leaks water, while the seller refuses to replace it or refund me. Too bad because the price wasn't low;1
600;Nothing much!; Unfortunately this bottle didn't convince me that much . The plastic material appears fragile and the thermal resistance is not excellent. Nothing special compared to cheaper models that do the same job;1
601;Bad collar; Unfortunately I have to say that this collar for my dog proved to be terrible. In fact, the material was too rigid, causing skin irritation. Also after a short time it started to break. Absolutely not to purchase;1
602;Surprise; I was positively surprised by this collar which looks cheap but has actually proven to be robust and resistant over time. Really well made, an excellent low cost purchase;1
603;Lousy collar; Unfortunately this collar was really gross. The material gave off bad odors and tended to chip, hurting my dog's fur. Completely unsuitable, I had to throw it away;1
604; Product does not conform to the description; I am disappointed to find that this collar did not match the description at all. It was of poor quality and the measurements were incorrect. I expected the goods introduced to be checked more ;1
605;Near perfect; Overall this collar proved to be almost perfect. Sturdy and durable, with careful stitching. Maybe just a little stiff but nothing serious. Excellent purchase that I recommend;1
606;Functional and practical.; This collar has proven to be functional and practical thanks also to the practical rotating carabiner. The nylon structure is also durable over time, resisting tears from my dog. Excellent quality -price ratio;1
607;Functional; Overall, this collar gave me good satisfaction by carrying out its function effectively. Solid and well made, an excellent ally for walking my dog safely. Nothing exceptional but valid;1
608; One of the few weekly magazines with cover in Italian; Finally a weekly pillbox with instructions also in Italian. Functional and well divided, it helps me take my daily medications correctly. Excellent purchase that facilitates good therapy;1
609;Returned; Unfortunately this pill box turned out to be defective with broken compartments. I promptly returned it to replace it with an intact product, essential for my health;1
610;Very bad.; I honestly have to say that this product is really terrible. Aesthetically ugly and rough, you risk losing the pads easily. Better to spend a little more for better items;1
611;Pill box; Overall, this pill box has proven to be practical and functional, with a good capacity and weekly sectioning. Nothing particularly sophisticated but it fulfills the purpose in a discreet manner;1
612;Damaged; Unfortunately this pill box arrived with some compartments already broken . Definitely transport damage that compromised its use. I promptly replaced it to have an intact product;1
613;Coarse; I must admit that this pill box, in addition to having a rough workmanship which makes it unpleasant to look at, tends to easily lose pills if handled. More accurate solutions are better ;1
614;Good product; Overall this weekly pill box has proven to be reliable. Practical and well divided, it allows me to take the medicines correctly on a daily basis. Nothing sensational but still a good purchase;1
615;Robust; I must say that this metal pill holder has proven to be robust and resistant over time. Well-sealed compartments prevent loss of pads. Definitely a good choice for prolonged use;1
616;Robust; This charger has proven to be very solid and resistant. Even after many months of use it is intact with no signs of wear. It guarantees its functions flawlessly by charging your devices correctly. Nothing to say other than praise, it certainly represents an excellent investment;1
617;fair+; Overall, this product does its job discreetly, charging the devices in a dignified way. Certainly nothing exceptional but it respects the basic use without any defects whatsoever. In terms of quality -price ratio it behaves honestly;1
618;Ineffective; Unfortunately I have to note that this charger is not at all effective with my devices, charging them very slowly or sometimes not even at all. Clearly unsuitable for the purpose, I think it is better to rely on more solid brands ;1
619;DON'T BUY IT JUST WASTE THE MONEY; I absolutely advise against purchasing this product, which proved to be completely useless and defective right from the start. Not only does it not charge, but it also risks damaging your devices. Money literally down the drain! A real shame;1
620;Useless; I remain disappointed by this product which in fact proved to be totally useless and ineffective, providing no practical support. Of course this was to be expected given the fragility of the materials. Better to spend a little more for better solutions;1
621;Nothing special; I must admit that this charger has no particular advantages or disadvantages. It carries out its basic task discreetly but without leaving its mark. In short, nothing memorable, a normal product;1
622; Fake Tiredness; Unfortunately I have to find that this charger is not at all precise in indicating the remaining charge status through the indicator light. He often appears tired before his time, nullifying his main function;1
623;It doesn't work for me it doesn't vibrate it just turns on the light well I don't recommend it; Clearly I can only advise against purchasing this product, which is completely ineffective for me. Not only does it not charge, but it even risks damaging much more expensive devices. Better to spend a little more for reliability ;1
624;Scratches, splits and stains; I am very disappointed with this product which is already damaged in the packaging. In addition to scratches and chips, it also had unsightly stains. Clearly a sign of poor care during packaging and shipping;1
625;Compact and functional.; I must admit that this charger guarantees reliable and fast charging thanks to its compact size. Nothing exceptional but it fully respects its functions without any defects. It represents an honest choice;1
626; DOES NOT work with Electronic Identity Cards - Assistance DOES NOT respond; Unfortunately this charger is not compatible with all devices on the market, in fact it is not able to read electronic identity cards, making it completely useless for my purposes. A serious design flaw;1
627;Useful; This charger has proven useful for my daily needs. It carries out its task of fast and safe charging, without efficiency problems. Simple but functional, it represents a valid investment also considering the honest price;1
628;Good; On average this charger met my expectations. It charges the device well without unnecessary demands. Nothing special but it behaves honestly overall, especially in relation to the affordable price;1
629;Yet to be fully evaluated; It is still early to give a complete opinion on this product, having only used it for short periods. So far I have not encountered any problems but only prolonged use will confirm the actual quality and durability over time. I am waiting for validation;1
630;To be improved in terms of aesthetics, materials and PRICE!; This charger certainly has room for improvement, such as a more refined aesthetic finish and the use of less economical materials. The price also seemed excessive for the real performance. With some improvements it would have been worth more ;1
631;Good value for money; This dermaroller offers good value for money . The microtips work effectively by stimulating skin cell renewal. Nothing to object other than the slight discomfort during use, but the results compensate for the small inconvenience;1
632;Plammaxs Microneedle Derma Roller; This dermaroller does its job correctly thanks to the microtips that act deep into the skin, stimulating its regeneration processes. A functional accessory at a fair price.;1
633; Effective on pain and mood; I must admit that this dermaroller has positively benefited my mood and the relief from minor muscle pain. An effect that I didn't expect and which improved my daily routine;1
634;To check...; I purchased this dermaroller having doubts about its real effectiveness. During the trial period I did not notice significant changes in the skin, perhaps it is time to check these products better;1
635; fun training only noisy flaw; This hula hoop is fun to use but unfortunately it emits an annoying and continuous noise due to the plastic wheels. A defect that precludes its use at home so as not to annoy others.;1
636;Good even if noisy; I must confirm that this hula hoop performs its toning function well, involving various abdominal muscles. Unfortunately the noise produced is excessive and annoying even for prolonged use. Nothing transcendental;1
637;Not completely satisfied; This hula hoop allowed me to tone my core but unfortunately it slides too much on my waist, not allowing for an optimal workout. I would have liked non-slip wheels or an adjustable belt to better adapt it to the body;1
638;But........; This hula hoop seemed to promise well but... once used I found that the plastic wheels slide too much on the skin, not guaranteeing the stability necessary for the exercise. A real shame!;1
639;Does its job; I must admit that despite some defects this hula hoop does its job of abdominal toning correctly, although perhaps less effectively than professional models. Nothing essential but it does its job;1
640;interesting idea but it has some flaws...; This slimming hula hoop seems like a stimulating idea but unfortunately the plastic wheels slide too much on the skin and it is very noisy to use at home. It would have needed improvements to be fully functional;1
641;In my opinion it's also a bit dangerous...; Using this hula hoop I had some balance problems due to the poor adherence to the body. Considering that I am almost 50 years old, perhaps it would be appropriate to choose more stable equipment to avoid the risk of falls.;1
642;Slimming hula hoop, good idea but needs reviewing; The basic idea of this slimming hula hoop is inspiring but the practical implementation is lacking . The wheels slide too much on the skin to ensure safe training. It is also excessively noisy. To be reviewed;1
643; Functional and working plastic wheels and a little high price; This hula hoop works correctly in its simplicity but the plastic material of the wheels is fragile and the price is perhaps excessive. Nothing that hinders its use but some improvements would be appreciated.;1
644;Interesting idea; The basic idea of this hula hoop integrated with targeted exercises seems inspiring. I hope that other models will correct the flaws found in terms of stability and noise, in order to make the most of the benefits of the tool;1
645;NOT SUITABLE FOR MEN; Unfortunately I must point out that the structure of this hula hoop is too narrow to be used safely by men, who have wider hips and waists . Better to opt for professional male models;1
646;It works but..; Unfortunately, this umbrella works correctly - I noticed that when subjected to strong weather conditions, it tends to deform slightly. Nothing compromising but it doesn't excel in terms of resistance;1
647;Does not resist bad weather; Unfortunately I have to point out that this umbrella was irreparably ruined due to water and wind after just a few uses. Clearly not suitable for prolonged use, I was hoping for greater robustness.;1
648;USELESS; Honestly, these car gadgets are totally useless. In fact, they are not mounted securely and the wind tends to detach them. There is no point in risking losing them, it is better to avoid them;1
649;Bad glue; I was disappointed by the poor quality of the glue on these accessories. If thick, they detach from the glass after a few days and are completely ineffective. Product not to be purchased at all;1
650;Not worth its price; Unfortunately I have to say that this umbrella is not worth the cost. In fact, the material is too light and tends to deteriorate quickly. Better to choose more resistant items ;1
651;Avengers child umbrella; This Avengers themed umbrella is definitely cute and of decent quality. Unfortunately, however, the plasticized sheet tends to get ruined in the pouring rain. Nothing serious but can be improved;1
652;Not even.; I honestly can only advise against the use of this product. In fact, the smell was too penetrating and persistent, almost intolerable. Articles with a more discreet fragrance are better;1
653;Ok; Overall, this car gadget has proven to be functional for its purpose. Certainly not the highest quality but as an economical solution it's fine. Nothing exceptional but the price is honest .;1
654;Quality/price ok; Overall this mug offers good value for money thanks also to an attractive design. Nothing perfect obviously but as a low cost gift idea it is spot on;1
655;Display mug; Unfortunately I have to say that this cup, in addition to being too small in size, after a few uses it started to chip on the edge. It seems more suitable for mere exhibition value than practical;1
656;You can be better; This cup could improve simply by lengthening the handle, which is almost non-existent, forcing uncomfortable carrying with two fingers. A small flaw that affects its practicality is ;1
657;Unsatisfactory; I have to admit disappointment after a few uses of this mug. In fact, the decoration, a shy little mouse, has progressively lost its details and brilliance with washing. Too bad about the surrender over time;1
658;Disney Mickey Mouse Mug; This mug depicting Mickey Mouse thrilled me thanks to the brilliant details taken care of down to the smallest detail. It seems really sturdy and well made. Sure to make little Disney fans happy ;1
659;It looks like a toy; Honestly, this car gadget seemed more like a toy than a functional accessory. In fact, it tends to detach easily from the glass, making it unsafe. Stably anchored solutions are better.;1
660;Completely disappointed with the article; I am sincerely disappointed with this purchase. In fact, the article, in addition to being too cheap in terms of materials, was noticeably damaged after a few uses. Absolutely wasted money, to be avoided;1
661;Product unsafe!; I strongly advise against this cover, as it seems to release substances during use. Furthermore, sharp edges can be dangerous, especially for children. Similar products should guarantee maximum safety for users;1
662;The graphic part is a warning sticker.; I am perplexed by the fact that the design is made only with an adhesive rather than with resistant paint. Normal use is enough for it to partially detach. Little care in the design phase for an accessory that could have been better;1
663;TO AVOID!; I absolutely do not recommend this cover. In addition to the poor quality of the materials, I found excessive noise and overheating, a sign of rough construction which compromises prolonged use.;1
664;A big piece of crap; Honestly, this cover turned out to be a huge disappointment. In addition to a design that leaves something to be desired, after a few days it started to noticeably deform and lost its grip on the phone. Money literally down the drain;1
665;First impression? 2 stars but I would like to change my mind.; At the moment my expectations for this cover are low. The workmanship seems cheap and the protection precarious. I hope to change my mind with use, otherwise it will have to be replaced to find more reliable products;1
666;Returned!; Unfortunately I had to return this cover, as annoying defects became apparent after the first uses, such as poor adhesion and colors that lost brilliance. Clearly not deemed suitable;1
667;Not good for magsafe!; I must admit that this cover does not prove to be perfectly compatible with MagSafe technology, given that the magnetic grip is less effective than expected. It probably had to be designed specifically for this function;1
668;Complicated, I personally didn't like it; This cover turned out to be too rough and complex for my tastes, with heavy buckles and plastic that compromise its handling. Personally I prefer more minimal and essential solutions ;1
669;Bad product; Unfortunately I have to give a negative opinion on this cover which, in addition to poor construction quality, immediately highlighted serious design defects that make regular use difficult. Not to be considered;1
670;Arrived in a different shape model; I am disappointed to note that this cover arrived in a completely different version than the one ordered, with mismatched measurements and accessories. Definitely a non-negligible packaging error;1
671; Compatible, it almost seems like the one from the parent company; I have to admit that this cheap cover looks remarkably similar to the original. Of course the materials are less valuable but it guarantees good protection. Nothing bad considering the low price.;1
672;It seems like a good product but...; This cover seems to offer excellent potential as it is resistant and light, however I found a poor magnetic adhesion which could cause the phone to fall. Maybe some improvements would have made it perfect;1
673;BAD! Avoid it like the plague!!!; I absolutely strongly advise against this cover, which in addition to an unwatchable design has proven to be defective and dangerous, overheating the device excessively. A product to avoid like the plague;1
674;Bubbles on both films; Disappointed to note that both protective films included have unsightly air bubbles, a sign of poor care in processing and packaging. Money wasted on a poorly made accessory;1
675;Good cover; I must admit that this cover fulfills its basic purpose of protection well. Nothing sensational but functional and resistant. It certainly represents a valid choice also considering the honest price that makes it accessible;1
676;It is not transparent; Unfortunately this screen protective film is not completely transparent as declared, resulting slightly opaque. A defect that compromises its aesthetics while protecting the display well from scratches. I would have liked greater correspondence to the characteristics;1
677; Convenient sim but price dropped next day; This film seemed like a good buy until the next day I saw the price drop. A shame because it seems to do its protection job well despite some possible application improvements.;1
678;Beautiful is transparent; I must say that this protective film proved to be excellent, completely transparent and invisible once applied. Effectively protects the screen without compromising visibility and touch sensitivity. Nothing to object to;1
679;Absolutely NOT!; I strongly advise against purchasing this film as it is completely useless. In fact, after a few days it detached itself from the phone screen, effectively nullifying the protective function. Wasted money;1
680;Good but can be improved!; This film did its job of protecting the screen from scratches but would have required better adhesion to the curved edges of the display to avoid lifting over time. Nothing compromising but some improvements;1
681; iPhone screen protector; I must say that applying this film was not very easy but once put on it proved to be effective in preserving the screen of my iPhone. Nothing to say other than the need to be even more precise in the pose;1
682;Good but a little slippery grip; This film proved to be excellent in protecting the screen of my smartphone without compromising its touch sensitivity. Perhaps the grip is a little slippery but it does its job very well;1
683;Pleasantly Surprised…Very Goog..!; I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this film which adheres perfectly to the screen without bubbles or imperfections. The material is thin and flexible without affecting visibility . Excellent value for money .;1
684;Excellent; This film performed its task of protecting my phone screen from scratches and impacts impeccably. The material is robust , flexible and transparent. Nothing to complain about a product that has kept its promises;1
685;Bad after-sales service; Unfortunately, in case of problems, the customer service of this film proved to be terrible and not very attentive. After it broke due to a fall, they refused to replace the product, effectively voiding the warranty;1
686;Waste of money; I was very disappointed by this film which after a few days loosened on its own and completely detached from the screen. Money practically wasted given the expectations of long-term protection;1
687;Very difficult to remove; Applying this film correctly was not at all easy given the tiny air bubbles that remained. It is even more difficult to remove it without ruining the screen in the attempt. It would have required better materials;1
688;"UPDATE (17Dec21) - Excellent product... with a ""but""";" This film has proven to be excellent in protecting the screen of my smartphone in a transparent and durable way. Perhaps the only ""but"" is the difficulty of removal without leaving residues which requires special tools";1
689;They are not made of tempered glass; Unfortunately this film is not made of tempered glass as declared but is made of normal plastic. As a result, it does not offer the promised high resistance and tends to break in impacts. Misleading information;1
690; Alter display colors; I must admit that this film, although it protects the screen well, tends to slightly alter the colors making them appear darker and less natural. Nothing serious but a slight reduction in visual quality;1
691; perfect; This film turned out to be simply perfect. Extreme cutting precision and millimetric finish. Furthermore, the adhesive adhered perfectly to the display without leaving bubbles. Truly excellent product;1
692;Excellent!; This protective film proved to be excellent, guaranteeing good screen protection. Light and colourless, it does not affect visibility at all . It is certainly a valid low cost investment;1
693;Shouldn't they last longer?; Overall, this film fulfilled its purpose well, unfortunately - after only a few months it started to lift at the edges and lose adhesion. I hope for future models with greater durability;1
694;applicator unusable; Unfortunately this film turned out to be defective, with the paper applicator totally useless and torn. A shame, I would have liked to check the quality - it seemed good. Better, more accurate controls ;1
695;Recommended!; I must say that this protective film proved to be excellent in every respect. Precise, easy to apply and resistant over time. Nothing to complain about other than a really affordable price. Highly recommended;1
696;Quality; Overall this film fully respects the quality described . Light and colourless, it adheres perfectly without leaving bubbles. Nothing revolutionary but for the price it's really worth it;1
697;I thought better; Unfortunately I have to admit that I expected slightly more from this film. In fact, it tends to lift at the edges after a short time, no longer providing effective protection;1
698;Save your display from scratches and accidental drops? You can do it well and at little expense!; This film has proven to be an excellent low cost purchase to protect my phone from bumps and scratches. Simple to apply, adheres firmly without increasing bulk. Without a doubt recommended!;1
699;Easy to install; I must say that this film is extremely easy to apply, thanks also to the aid kit. Furthermore, once applied it adheres perfectly without leaving air bubbles. Excellent product;1
700; Low quality adhesive applicator too narrow; Unfortunately this film turned out to be faulty, with the applicator too narrow for my phone. Furthermore, the adhesive has a poor hold over time, partially detaching. Disappointing;1
701;Also No; I honestly do not recommend this purchase. In fact, the film, in addition to having a workmanship and colors that are too cheap, tends to quickly deteriorate by detaching from the screen. Better to opt for more reliable brands ;1
702;Installation tool not included; A shame that this film doesn't include any tools for perfect posing. It is therefore more complicated to apply with maximum precision. A defect that partially affects its ease of use;1
703;Does not adhere well and creates bubbles; Unfortunately I have to say that this film did not meet my expectations. In fact, it tends to create annoying air bubbles which affect its aesthetics. Does not stick as firmly as hoped;1
704;Decent; Overall, this protective film served its purpose fairly well for a fair price. Certainly nothing perfect but it ensures decent scratch protection for the display;1
705; Price quality super ok; I must admit that this film really presents an excellent quality -price ratio. Resistant and precise, it does not affect the visibility of the screen even with reflections. Definitely a valid low cost investment;1
706;Not your usual thriller; This novel breaks away from the usual clichés of the genre, offering less obvious plots and multi-faceted characters. Certainly not an adrenaline-pumping pageturner but a thought-provoking character study. Nothing scandalous but I appreciate the originality � ;1
707;An unusual noir that makes you think; I must admit that I was pleasantly impressed by this work that combines noir with social drama. Dark settings but also points of denunciation that invite us to look beyond the surface. An author to keep an eye on for his qualities . ;1
708;Inconclusive; Unfortunately I must say that this novel is far too cumbersome and inconclusive, dispersed in secondary plots that distort the plot. A real shame given the excellent initial characterization of the characters. He deserved more rigor;1
709;Low quality plastic; I am disappointed by the poor quality of the plastic materials of this accessory which, after just a few uses, began to noticeably deteriorate, losing its compactness. Clearly it does not guarantee the durability that I expected for the function;1
710;Good article; I must admit that this accessory performs its function effectively, proving to be robust and resistant. Nothing exceptional but it certainly represents a good purchase considering the economical list price;1
711;It doesn't work well; Unfortunately I have to note that this accessory has obvious operating problems, proving unreliable after a short time. A serious defect in an electronic component that affects the overall reliability of the product;1
712;Do not buy them; I strongly advise against purchasing this accessory which has proven to be completely inadequate. In addition to poor performance, I have encountered malfunctions that make it effectively unusable. Better to focus on more reliable brands ;1

714;connection does not work; Unfortunately I have to point out that the wireless connection of this accessory does not work correctly, appearing to be unstable and discontinuous. Clearly a serious flaw that clearly affects its main usefulness;1
715;We're not there!; I remain very disappointed by this accessory which has proven to be completely inadequate for the purpose, with approximate and limited performance. For the price paid I would have expected much more in terms of quality and performance;1
716;Good value for money but....; Overall, this accessory offers a decent quality -price ratio but having found poor durability over time, I doubt it can be defined as truly convenient. It could have been designed more solidly ;1
717; Duration 11 minutes; I am disappointed by the very limited autonomy of this accessory, which guarantees just 11 minutes of use before running out of battery completely. Clearly insufficient and far from promises. Unfortunately wasted money;1
718;Good; I must admit that this accessory fully met my expectations. Nothing revolutionary but it performs its fast charging function very well without ever causing problems. Due to their low cost they represent an optimal choice;1
719;Good but...; Overall, this accessory performs its charging function well but has a significant flaw. In fact, it tends to overheat excessively during use, which could compromise its lifespan over time;1
720; Excellent value for money; For the real performance provided, I must recognize that this accessory offers excellent value for money . In fact, it guarantees lightning-fast recharges at an honest cost. Without a doubt among the best in its economic range;1
721;Embarrassing sound quality; Unfortunately I have to reject these headphones, disappointed by the truly poor audio quality. The sound is distorted and devoid of detail, almost embarrassing to listen to. Impossible to use them seriously, I hope it's an isolated case;1
722;Mediocre; These headphones proved to be mediocre in every respect. The sound is poor in bass and shrill highs, while the fit is not the best. Nothing worthwhile at this price, I expected more . ;1
723;Maybe good for music but not for making calls; Unfortunately, these headphones are not suitable for phone calls, with voices that sound indistinct and metallic. Better to use them only for listening to music where they minimize defects.;1
724;Excellent but I caught the defective ones; I was disappointed to receive a defective pair, with sound from only one earbud. I hope it was an unfortunate exception otherwise they denote poor production quality;1
725;Bad product; I must absolutely advise against these headphones, expectations are totally unfulfilled. The sound is flat and croaky, the battery lasts very little. Wasted money!;1
726;Excellent product; I must admit that these headphones live up to their promises by providing excellent balanced audio quality. The earphones also fit perfectly ensuring prolonged listening. Excellent purchase;1
727;Well; These headphones do their job discreetly but nothing exceptional. The sound is average and the fit is not the best. Perhaps they are fine for what I use them for;1
728;The game is not worth the candle.; Unfortunately I have to say that despite some additional functions, the game is not worth the candle given the sound and comfort defects of these headphones. Better to opt for more balanced models . ;1
729;I MAY HAVE BEEN UNLUCKY BUT....; I would have liked these headphones but unfortunately after a few days of use they started to lose power from an earphone. A failure that is too early;1
730;It's not 4k and it doesn't even reach FULL HD!!!; I was disappointed to find that this camera does not film in Full HD as stated, stopping at much lower quality. A lack of transparency on the real characteristics;1
731;It works but has some problems; This camera does its job discreetly but unfortunately has some image stabilization problems and a lot of noise in dark videos. Nothing unsolvable but needs improvement;1
732;Another disappointment; Unfortunately I also have to reject this purchase, lack of expectations compared to the price. The video quality is grainy and the focus is slow and imprecise. Better to turn to more reliable brands ;1
733;Does what it promises; I must say that this video camera met my needs by producing clear and stabilized shots, as promised . Nothing revolutionary but it works correctly;1
734;does not correspond to the description at all; Unfortunately this camera is not at all compatible with my smartphone as described, unable to connect. A lack of correct information which jeopardized its use;1
735;I finally connected it and it works; After some initial doubts, I managed to successfully connect this camera to my cell phone via the app. The shots are discreet, I hope it keeps its promises over time;1
736;Great video camera but...; This video camera guarantees clear and detailed footage, however I must point out that it tends to overheat after prolonged use, compromising its performance. Nothing serious but can be improved;1
737;No wifi connection; Despite having a clear optics, this camera totally lacks the fundamental wifi options. As a result, it is difficult to transfer footage, a serious shortcoming for the price range;1
738;Either I was unlucky or it's a package; Unfortunately this camera totally disappointed me. In fact, after a few minutes of recording, an annoying rustling noise appeared which affected its use. Clearly a manufacturing defect;1
739;Very bad; Honestly, I must categorically advise against this product. The video quality is very low even in bright light, with faded colours. Defective goods, absolutely do not purchase.;1
740;I use it at home in the kitchen with my cell phone; This video camera discreetly fulfills the purpose of filming my home activities. Of course, nothing sophisticated but low cost is more than fine for my non-professional videos;1
741;resolution; Overall, this video camera offers good image clarity although the maximum resolution is just sufficient and not excellent. Nothing serious considering the price;1
742;Network connection not working therefore setup impossible; Unfortunately this purchase turned out to be disappointing as the camera does not allow any wifi connection, making it impossible to install the firmware. Malfunctioning product;1
743; excellent video quality; I must say that this video camera guarantees truly excellent video quality even in low light conditions. Nothing to complain about except perhaps an excessive price;1
744;Headphones; Overall these headphones fulfilled their purpose well, however I must point out that after a short time they started to cause me annoying headaches, perhaps not very ergonomic;1
745;Nice comfortable mah; Overall, these headphones offer decent music listening although, as reported by other reviews, after a few months the battery life has almost halved. Nothing compromising for now.;1
746; Strong buzzing on the left; Unfortunately I have to point out that these headphones have an annoying buzz coming from the left earpiece. An evident manufacturing defect which totally invalidates its use for musical purposes;1
747;Structural defects; I was disappointed to find that these headphones, in addition to having just enough sound, soon showed structural failures in the elastics and connections. Quality problems � ;1
748;Unsuitable for running; I must admit that these headphones are not very suitable for intensive sporting activity. In fact, during the run, they tended to move too much, resulting in them being uncomfortable and annoying in the long run;1
749;Not enough charging wire; Unfortunately, the charging cable supplied with these headphones is really too short, making the operation cumbersome near the electrical socket. A detail that should be improved;1
750; They have clear and crystalline sound; I must confirm that these headphones guarantee excellent crystal clear sound, perfectly balanced. Nothing to say other than an excellent quality -price ratio. Without a doubt I recommend them;1
751;Changing rating after a couple of months of use; As I am still in the trial period of this device, my rating may change over time. To date it performs its functions well but only prolonged use will confirm whether it meets its promises in the long term. For now it doesn't disappoint;1
752;Smart watch; This smartwatch performs the basic notification and activity tracking functions well . Nothing sensational but it represents an honest accessory also considering the affordable price. I'm waiting to see how it holds up over time.;1
753;Having arrived a few days ago I am not able to evaluate it; Unfortunately it is still early to be able to fully evaluate this device, having received it too recently. The potential seems excellent but only prolonged use will confirm its real capabilities . I'm waiting for a more concrete use;1
754;Unreliable values; I must note that this device does not guarantee precise measurements in the recorded parameters, offering data that does not always correspond to reality . An important limitation that compromises its actual reliability is as a healthcare instrument;1
755;I don't recommend it; Based on my brief experience I can only strongly advise against this device, which is found to be lacking in many respects. Money that would be better invested in more performing and reliable products;1
756;BAD IF NOT RIDICULOUS; I am literally baffled by the very poor quality of this accessory. The materials are worthy of a newspaper cover and the finishes are even dangerous. A real waste of money that I should never have made;1
757; Fantastic Sound; I must admit that the audio reproduction of these headphones is simply exceptional, full of detail and body . The sound envelops listening in an engaging way. Without a doubt among the best in this price range;1
758;The headphones do not last 5-7 hours as described; Unfortunately I found that the battery life of these headphones is considerably lower than what was declared by the manufacturer. After a few hours of use they need to be recharged, making them uncomfortable to use outside the home. A non-negligible flaw.;1
759;"Very light ""correction""";" I have to correct the definition of ""very light"" given to these headphones, as they are quite heavy to wear especially after long hours. Perhaps it would have been better to use a less bulky material";1
760; excellent mat; I have to admit that this mat has proven to be excellent. It guarantees a comfortable and wear-resistant surface. Nothing exceptional but it fulfills its function perfectly, representing a wise purchase also considering the affordable price;1
761;Nice and cheap but not the best; These headphones do the job with dignity but without drawing applause. The sound is normal and the materials are cheap. Nothing serious at this low price, they still represent a valid choice for those who don't have high demands;1
762;Color does not match; I am disappointed to find that the color of this accessory does not match what was advertised at all. A non-negligible detail that invalidates the purchase choice, presupposing untrue information. ;1
763;Is this device worth it? Ni....; I honestly have serious doubts about the usefulness of purchasing this device, given that to date it does not seem to provide concrete advantages compared to less expensive solutions. Unless there is a decisive improvement in potential , I do not consider it convenient;1
764;Returned; Unfortunately, this accessory completely disappointed expectations, showing obvious defects from the beginning. I was unable to use it any further and requested a return, to be reimbursed for a purchase that turned out to be incorrect;1
765;Zero rating; Considering the defects that emerged, the only rating I can give to this product is zero . Poor materials, modest performance, very rapid wear. Waste of money, I hope to avoid similar disappointments in the future by choosing more reliable brands;1
766;Inconvenient; Unfortunately, these headphones become really uncomfortable to wear after a short time, with the earphones causing pain in the ears by squeezing them. A shame because at the beginning they seemed stable, but prolonged listening is impossible ;1
767;Bad audio; I was disappointed by the very low audio quality of these headphones, with a metallic and distorted sound, completely lacking in detail and power. Absolutely not able to guarantee a pleasant listening experience;1
768;no one hears me; Unfortunately, the microphone integrated into these headphones does not adequately perform its task. The speaker is heard in a distorted way, while at the same time I myself am unable to be audible to the interlocutor during calls.;1
769;THEY ARRIVED BUT DIFFERENT FROM THOSE ON SALE; I was surprised to receive a product different from the one shown in the advertisement. An error that forced me to return the item that did not correspond to what was purchased in good faith;1
770;Product returned; After a few days of use these headphones started losing power from one earpiece, forcing me to return them as defective. A lifespan too short compared to what I would have expected;1
771; Different from those in the photo; Unfortunately these headphones look nothing like the ones pictured in the ad. An important detail that would have required more truthful photos to avoid generating incorrect expectations;1
772;Buy consciously; It is essential to inform yourself properly before purchasing the specific model, checking reviews and technical specifications to understand if it corresponds to your real listening needs.;1
773;Review; These headphones do their job discreetly but nothing more . The sound is average but the earphones become uncomfortable to wear for a long time after a short time. Overall not satisfactory;1
774;FFp2 black; The Ffp2 masks included with this order are comfortable to wear and fit well to the face thanks to the adjustable nose piece. The black color also makes them discreet from an aesthetic point of view. Nothing to say.;1
775;The laces are too short; Unfortunately, the elastic bands on these masks are so short that they do not fit properly on most adult faces. A size defect that actually compromises its use.;1
776;Suitable product; These Ffp2 masks fully comply with safety standards by providing an adequate protective barrier. The elastics are also comfortable and the multiple pack allows for replacement. Definitely purchasable;1
777;Masks; I can't say enough about these masks for their solidity , comfort and adherence to the face even when you sweat. They filter effectively while holding firmly in place. Certainly consistent with the protective purpose.;1
778;TOO easy to remove; Unfortunately, these masks are too easy to remove accidentally, slipping on the face even with minimal movements. A defect that effectively nullifies its correct use in many circumstances;1
779;Functional but a little uncomfortable; I must admit that these masks perform their filtering task well but are slightly uncomfortable to wear for prolonged periods due to the tight fit. Nothing serious but some improvements would be appreciated;1
780;To be better evaluated; These masks still need to be tested extensively before giving a complete judgement. For now they seem reliable but some details such as comfort and durability over time should be better evaluated;1
781;I thought better; I must admit that I expected slightly more from this neck warmer. In fact, the heating, although rapid, does not last sufficiently long on the coldest days . Nothing compromising but improvable;1
782; Rapid heating and thermo-preserving fabric; This neck warmer has proven to be excellent against the cold thanks to its rapid heating and heat-insulating fabric. Furthermore, the fit is very comfortable even for long walks outdoors.;1
783;LITTLE; Unfortunately I have to say that this neck warmer was too small for my neck. I risked suffocating myself rather than warming up. I should have checked the measurements better when purchasing;1
784;Simple but quite effective.; Overall, this neck warmer fulfills its purpose discreetly, even if nothing sophisticated. Lightweight and warm, it represents an excellent economical solution for the coldest days . Nothing exceptional but the price is honest ;1
785;Be careful with the keys; I recommend paying attention to the materials of the buttons on this neck warmer which, being hard, risk scratching the face with accidental impacts. Nothing compromising but needs improvement;1
786;purchase to avoid; Unfortunately I strongly advise against this purchase. In fact, the neck warmer, in addition to being poorly made, gave off bad odors that made it unusable. Better to focus on more reliable brands ;1
787;Terrible!!!; This neck warmer turned out to be terrible in every respect. Very light to the point of not ensuring any insulation, with seams already frayed after a few uses. Absolutely wasted money;1
788;LEFT EARPHONE ARRIVED BROKEN; I was disappointed by these headphones that arrived already damaged , with the left earcup broken. Needless to say, they are useless as I received them. Brand to be wary of;1
789;They are worth what they cost...; Overall these headphones offer decent music listening for the price range. Clearly nothing exceptional but they fulfill their low cost purpose well. Of course they can be improved but overall they are worth the purchase;1
790;Good but not suitable for music; I must admit that these headphones are more suitable for podcasts and calls than for listening to music. In fact, the bass is weak and a certain dynamism is missing. Nothing serious but worth considering;1
791;They are not good for calls; Unfortunately I have to say that these headphones did not prove to be adequate for calls. In fact, the microphone tended to pick up too many external noises, making my voice unclear and audible;1
792;I didn't like them; Honestly, these headphones didn't completely convince me. The sound is flat and the fit is precarious causing discomfort after a short while. There are certainly better products at similar prices;1
793; microphone not up to par; Unfortunately I must point out that the microphone of these headphones does not ensure optimal voice reproduction during calls. Better models that emphasize the incoming audio more;1
794;A headset does not work; I was disappointed by these headphones which arrived already defective , with one earpiece not working. Needless to say, they are useless as I received them. Products to be replaced promptly;1
795;Another defective filmmaker; Unfortunately, these headphones, like the last purchase, also turned out to be defective as they arrived with the earphones detached. Clearly production problems to be sanctioned. I had to send them back;1
796;Nice but nothing special!!!; These headphones are aesthetically pleasing but nothing more . The sound is mediocre and the build quality shows signs of fragility . Nothing particularly bad, they just don't add any value compared to cheaper models . ;1
797;Audio ok, perfect comfort, terrible touch button!!!; I must admit that these headphones offer good audio and excellent comfort but unfortunately the touch button proved to be completely unreliable, often not working properly. A serious defect that affects daily use;1
798;Taken after 4 years of Apple headphones; After 4 years of excellent Apple headphones, I decided to experiment with these cheap ones. Nothing comparable but still honest considering the low price. They represent a valid alternative for those with reduced budgets;1
799;Too big for a woman; Unfortunately I have to note that these headphones are actually large and heavy, therefore not suitable for female use, making them uncomfortable even for short periods. Would have required more sizing options;1
800; Terrible headphones for everyday use; I strongly advise against these headphones for daily use given the poor quality of the materials and the precarious seal. After a few weeks they are already ruined . Better to choose more solid and long-lasting products ;1
801;Disappointment heats little or nothing.; I am disappointed by this support which actually heats the phone very little, making it almost useless during the winter. Of course, the low price suggested better performance. Unfortunately wasted money;1
802;Mobile phone holder that does its job well and with a good quality/price ratio.; I must admit that this support performs its function of attaching the smartphone in the car best, guaranteeing solidity thanks also to a good quality -price ratio. Nothing special but comfortable and reliable;1
803;Support from air conditioning is impractical; Unfortunately I have to note that this fan holder is not at all practical while driving. In fact, it tends to oscillate and vibrate excessively, remaining unstable. Maybe it should have been designed differently;1
804;For the price it seems OK; Considering the low cost, this accessory seems to offer decent performance. Nothing transcendental but it honestly carries out its supporting role without excessively affecting the purse. A decent quality -price ratio. ;1
805;comfortable; I must say that these headphones offer excellent comfort during long periods of listening, thanks also to soft padding. Overall the product keeps its promises in terms of ergonomics;1
806;After a few days they no longer turned on; I am disappointed with these headphones which after just a few days of use stopped turning on and connecting correctly. Clearly an unacceptable production defect that compromises reliability is in the medium term;1
807;Used for half an hour...; Unfortunately I have to note that these headphones started to lose audio power after just half an hour of use, a sign of poor battery quality. An early defect which demonstrates its lack of durability is ;1
808;For those who want to train without giving up music; These headphones proved to be excellent for workouts, resisting sweat and remaining stable. Furthermore, the enhanced sound allows you to immerse yourself in music even in the gym. Nothing to complain about, they work properly;1
809;Untrue data; I am disappointed to learn how the data on the technical sheet does not correspond to reality . For example, the autonomy is lower than declared, effectively nullifying the promises. Untruthful information that invalidates the choice;1
810; Nice graphics but poor content; Aesthetically these headphones are fascinating but unfortunately they are limited to that, given that the integrated musical contents are poor and sparse. For the real potential, the price is excessive. They deserved more ;1
811;It's good to know the time and nothing more; This smart watch discreetly carries out its task of indicating time and alarms. Unfortunately the other functions are very sparse and dated compared to other models. Nothing essential but could be improved;1
812;Unreliable headphones.; Unfortunately I have to reject these headphones which after a few months of use started to cause problems, with a headset that no longer charged correctly . A defect that affected its use, forcing me to replace it;1
813;Didn't charge a headset; After just two months of use, one of the two headphones is no longer able to charge properly. A too early malfunction which ruined the purchase, disappointing me due to the poor reliability � ;1
814;Product defective; Unfortunately, the headphones received immediately had a defect, with an earpiece that emitted an annoying hissing noise. A clearly non-compliant product that I had to promptly return;1
815;Disappointment; I was disappointed by the low quality of these headphones. After a few weeks they got ruined, losing their seal in the ears and the Bluetooth connection became unstable. Nothing like what I expected;1
816;Untrue data; Unfortunately, the technical data indicated in the advertisement did not correspond to reality . In fact, these headphones do not reach the advertised battery life and noise cancellation is almost absent. Untrue information;1
817;Beautiful graphics but poor content; The graphics of this smartwatch are captivating but unfortunately many promised functions are not present or perform poorly. Not very customizable and dated, disappointing compared to expectations;1
818;It's good to know the time and nothing more; Unfortunately I have to point out that this smartwatch discreetly only performs the task of indicating the time and alarm. All other promised features are actually unsupported or sparse. Not very satisfactory. ;1
819;Small size; This smartwatch has too small dimensions which make it difficult to read and uncomfortable to use, especially for those with large wrists. I would have liked a version with a larger screen ;1
820; Excellent value for money; I have to praise this smartwatch for the very affordable price and adequate performance. Monitor essential parameters discreetly. Nothing exceptional but an honest purchase;1
821; Excellent value for money; This watch satisfactorily and completely performs all the promised functions: health monitoring, notifications, music control. The economical price makes it a purchase worth considering;1
822;A good product; This smartwatch performs its notification, step counting and sleep monitoring functions effectively and with style. Battery life is also excellent . Nothing to object to a balanced product;1
823;Excellent; I must say that this smartwatch fully met my expectations, guaranteeing an excellent quality -price ratio. Completely monitor your workouts and health, with a fast and customizable interface;1
824;Bho; Unfortunately I was not completely convinced by this smartwatch. Although it performs some functions well, the software is wooden and not very fast. Nothing exciting compared to other models.;1
825;Bad finishing; I was disappointed by the lack of attention to detail on this watch. The metal inserts appear clumsy and out of tune, as is the plastic finish of the strap. Nothing that justifies the price;1
826;Small mask; Unfortunately I have to point out that this FFP2 mask is too small and tight for my face. A shame, I would have liked to check the filtering quality which seemed good.;1
827;Good but....; Overall, these masks proved to be excellent, unfortunately , as reported by other reviews, after a few washes they started to lose elasticity . Nothing compromising but improvable;1
828; Ffp2 KARAEASY Small Size masks; These small masks proved to be suitable for my physiognomy, guaranteeing a perfect fit to the face. The multi-pack is also convenient to always carry with you . Excellent purchase;1
829;Disgustingly cheap; I sincerely do not recommend this product whose construction quality is so poor that it makes one turn up their noses. It looks like a toy rather than a functional object. Better to spend a little more . ;1
830;Silent; I must say that these masks allow for an excellent fit without causing discomfort, also thanks to the flexible and comfortable material. Plus they are almost silent during use, which is essential for me;1
831;Useless; Unfortunately I have to admit that this product was not useful to me at all. Lightweight and not very stable, in fact it tends to move continuously and risks falling. Pointless expense, not recommended;1
832;The bass is missing, otherwise perfect; Overall these headphones offer clear and balanced sound, although they lack slightly body in the bass. Nothing serious though, they represent a good quality -price compromise.;1
833;Good product; I have to give a positive opinion on this set of screwdrivers which proved to be well built and assorted for multiple uses at home. The magnetic inserts also significantly improve handling;1
834; Convenient and useful for small jobs around the house!; This small set of 32 in 1 screwdrivers proved to be very useful for my small household jobs thanks to the good quality of the materials and the practicality of transport. Nothing extraordinary but effective;1
835;Fairedear 32 in 1 Small Screwdriver Set; As previously mentioned, this small screwdriver kit has proven to be effective and practical for home needs. Nothing perfect obviously but fairly satisfactory;1
836; Convenient and useful for small jobs around the house!; Unfortunately I have to confirm what has already been underlined . This screwdriver kit, in addition to being already worn , has tips that are too fragile and very flexible slats. Nothing durable over time, poor product;1
837;Fairedear 32 in 1 Small Screwdriver Set; Overall, these headphones offer decent music listening although, as reported by other reviews, after a few months the battery life has almost halved. Nothing compromising for now;1
838;It's rubber!!! The colors are duller than the image in the photo!!; I was disappointed to find that these headphones were not actually fabric but simple rubber, with the colors less bright than the advertising image. Untrue product, to be avoided;1
839;Well, they're not bad;" Overall, these headphones represent an economical solution for occasional listening. Of course, the sound isn't the best and the construction is cheap but all in all ""you can make do with the price""";1
840; strong solvent-like odor and small rubber bands; Unfortunately, from the moment you open the package, these headphones give off a strong chemical odor that is almost intolerable. Furthermore, the elastics are excessively tight. Not to be purchased;1
841;Quite good but with flaws; These masks perform their filtering function well but are not very secure to the face due to short elastic bands. Furthermore, the packaging is not airtight and there is a bad smell inside. Nothing serious but with some improvements they would have been perfect;1
842;Good quality Fpp2 mask; I must say that these masks are well made, with excellent adherence to the face thanks also to adjustable elastic bands. They also present the necessary safety certificates. Nothing to object to, they represent an excellent choice;1
843;Poor quality don't buy them.; Unfortunately I must strongly advise against the purchase of these masks, which have proven to be of poor quality with inadequate filtering. Money wasted on products that don't really protect against risks, as you would expect. ;1
844;very disappointed; I am sincerely disappointed by this purchase which did not meet expectations. The masks were found to be uncomfortable and of dubious filtering effectiveness. Wasted money that I hoped would guarantee greater protection;1
845; Excellent quality; I must say that these masks have proven to be excellent from all points of view. They offer excellent adhesion to the face and certainly guarantee a high protective barrier. Definitely recommended;1
846;Uncertainty about the authenticity of the product.; I have some doubts about the actual origin of these masks given the absence of official documentation. A non-negligible detail that undermines confidence in their certification and filtering safety;1
847; bad smell and 2 missing; Disappointed by this purchase which immediately presented some obvious defects, such as missing masks and unsealed packaging but giving off bad smells. Definitely a non-compliant product;1
848;Cute photo gadgets; These gadgets have proven to be nice accessories to add an ironic touch to souvenir photos. Nothing transcendental but they represent a light and easy-to-use gift idea, appreciated by my contacts;1
849;Not even.; Unfortunately I must say that these masks did not meet my expectations, being uncomfortable, poorly filtering and damaged upon opening the package. Clearly a bad purchase. ;1
850;Ok; These masks perform their duty correctly, guaranteeing a good adhesion to the face and an effective barrier. Nothing particularly exceptional but they still represent an honest choice also considering the purchase price;1
851; Quality/price ok; Overall these masks offer a decent quality -price ratio. Certainly not the best around but functional for daily use without excessive demands. Overall a convenient purchase;1
852;Display mug; Unfortunately I have to note that this cup is too fragile for daily use. Better to use it exclusively for display to avoid breakage, even if the price would have suggested greater solidity � ;1
853;A real rip-off; Honestly, these masks turned out to be a real disappointment. In addition to an uncomfortable fit , I found obvious manufacturing flaws that also cast doubt on its protection. Money wasted needlessly;1
854;You can be better; These masks certainly have room for improvement, such as a tighter fit and more high-performance materials . Nothing deficient, but with some adjustments they could have guaranteed higher standards.;1
855;Unsatisfactory; I remain dissatisfied with these masks which do not fully meet expectations. Terminated prematurely and inconvenient to use. For the cost we would have expected more durable products;1
856;Disney Mickey Mouse Mug; This Disney Mickey Mouse themed mug is really cute, it's a shame that the print turns out to be just a sticker that came off after just a few washes. A detail that nullified its aesthetic appearance after a short time.;1
857;It looks like a toy; Unfortunately this bottle, although pleasant in its Frozen guise, seemed to me to be made with materials that were too light and fragile, almost like toy plastic. Nothing to do with more resistant products at this price;1
858;Completely disappointed with the article; I was totally disappointed with this product. In addition to arriving broken, it immediately became further damaged after a few uses. Money wasted on an item lacking the minimum required quality . ;1
859;Product not safe!; I strongly advise against purchasing this non-certified plastic bottle. The materials appear too porous and untreated, potentially dangerous due to prolonged contact with hot liquids.;1
860;The graphic part is a sticker attention.; Unfortunately, this bottle also proved to be lacking, with the non-adherent themed print which came off after just one wash, making the product very deteriorated;1
861;TO AVOID!; I would like to warn against this totally unsuitable purchase. The water bottle made of poor quality plastic and without certifications was immediately damaged, losing millions of compartments. Malfunctioning product;1
862;Functional; I must admit that despite some small aesthetic defects, this bottle fully carries out its task of transporting liquids in a practical and healthy way, thanks to the anti-bacterial filter included;1
863;Elsa water bottle; My daughter is thrilled with this elegant and colorful Frozen bottle. Even though the print is just sticker, the tritan bottle is sturdy and keeps drinks fresh for a long time;1
864;this is not what was ordered; Unfortunately the order received did not correspond to the description. I had to return the item because it did not have the indicated accessories. Disappointing for sales fidelity;1
865;Resistant plastic; I must admit that despite the low price, this bottle is made of a truly impact-resistant and flexible plastic. Nothing has chipped or dented even after months of use;1
866;I bought it mainly for a game on steam.. but it doesn't allow me to use it to move....; Unfortunately this controller, although compatible with my PC, is not recognized by the specified game. A lack of clarity on the real compatibility is what thwarted the purchase;1
867;Recommended; This wireless controller has proven to be high-performance and reliable, with precise controls and a stable connection. Excellent quality-price ratio to play comfortably even on the sofa. Highly recommended;1
868;Review by the Vanitiromance blog ⭐⭐⭐⭐ 1/2; This water bottle represents an honest purchase, with an elegant design and robust material. The filter purifies water well although the size is not suitable for everyone. Overall passed.;1
869; Valid product; arrived on time. valid product, shame that some jars are dented and one has a leak of contents. all not caused by transport, the package was perfect but probably before packaging for shipping;0
870; It makes you sweat; the tank top really makes you sweat when you stand still, it doesn't sweat much but it goes without saying that you can't lose weight simply by wearing it. I got a size S which is a little wide on my shoulders. I'm 156 cm tall and I weigh around fifty kilos but overall more small I think it would be too narrow. integrated into a balanced and active diet and worn during physical activity it certainly helps to lose a few cm recommended;0
871;NHEIMA tank top.;the tank top has an excellent material finished very well in the seams.I have the size S. to put it on as it didn't have any elasticity I thought it would tear. After a lot of effort I managed it. perfect. It also holds the model to remove it. I asked for help. so pay attention to the sizes. SM. I have broad shoulders and quite full breasts. So I'm returning it and I'll get an XL. a shame because the time I used it for 10 minutes I couldn't stand it anymore. it would definitely make me sweat a lot. I repeat, the rest is very good material. I recommend it. I made a mistake with the size;0
872;Difficult to wear.;the product is visually perfect, consistent fabric, perfect finishing but... not having an insert in elastic fabric, a zip or velcro, putting it on is very tiring at a certain point I thought I was stuck but then I managed to get it down .I hope that over time with use and washing it will give just enough to be able to put it on without help.;0
873; Uncomfortable and large; I had an absurd effort putting it on.. I asked for help because with long hair it's a disaster to wear it.. once put on it doesn't fit me even though I took the smallest size and it doesn't even make me sweat a lot .. sickening odor;0
874;Bad purchase;absolutely unusable! It may be that I bought the wrong size... but if you have large breasts the shirt won't fit and if you manage to slip it on it won't come out again. Furthermore, the smell it gives off is horrible and doesn't go away even when washed.;0
875; Overall very good.; Speed of delivery and packaging was good. the product lives up to expectations, it has an unpleasant odor after the first two uses but it disappears after cleaning. it's fine if you wear it under everyday winter clothing, not suitable under summer clothing. recommended.;0
876;warm;I find it useful because it warms the back area well which is why I use it when playing squash. It makes you sweat but not a lot. I don't think it can be useful for losing weight. It doesn't fit perfectly, it has a few wrinkles but it was the right size;0
877; Purchase of a fitness tank top and leggings; it works. Upon arrival, the item gave off a strong plastic smell, for this reason I recommend washing it immediately before use. Since the sizes are not too accurate, buying a larger size and wearing it with a tank top or leggings underneath may be the best solution;0
878; NOT GOOD; I had to take the xl and as a side it is fine the problem is the rest which has numerous defects on the back it is full of creases and with the t-shirt on it seems to be deformed. unfortunately another flaw is the terrible smell of the material : Even after washing the tank top numerous times, that low-quality polyester smell doesn't go away, it also permeates the clothes;0
879; Good but fragile; the product is good. I took a size up reading the reviews but it wasn't needed. However, upon first use two holes formed on the yellow part on the back side, probably due to the bra. I hope they don't expand perhaps it should be written that it should only be used with sports bras.;0
880; Good; very effective. I don't make any more at least I'm happy with it. The only flaw is that the matching shorts I got are much smaller in size and I don't fit in them but the piece above is fantastic. it makes you sweat a lot when you play sports, I recommend it;0
881; Good value for money; excellent shipping. The product arrived a day early. As indicated in the various comments, I also took a size larger than that. I normally fit wide. The tank top fits me well and is just a little long. the undershirt works by using it during sporting activity you sweat more. good value for money;0
882;Does its job well;excellent, makes you really sweat but is a little uncomfortable to wear. purchased size L for 66 kg but I struggle to wear it a little because it is a little stiff, perhaps a size larger would have been better even if it will give a little over time. satisfied anyway!;0
883;I wouldn't buy it again;Chinese product with a terrible smell, despite having washed it over and over again the smell almost remains on the skin. the vest does not adhere well in the woven parts and therefore has no use.;0
884;rigid fabric with non-compliant sizes;I bought a L to keep me in a slightly larger size than the M of normal t-shirts but despite it being impossible to put on as it is a rigid fabric and has no side opening or other useless product;0
885; it doesn't smell and the size is right!; I just received it within a day of ordering and I'm writing a review to clarify the many disagreements I've read. the smell is normal, it seems like a diving suit and I just opened it and put it on so it's very manageable. regarding the size, I have an Italian 44/46 and I took a L. perfect. a little tight to put on but now I have it on it must be worn snug otherwise you don't need a size up it would have been loose. it's like a bodysuit now I have other clothes on top and it doesn't bother me. I'm only giving 3 stars because I don't yet know if it will work but for now my opinion is positive;0
886;Disappointed;unfortunately it has a very bad smell, I haven't been able to remove it either by washing the tank top or by leaving it out in the air for days and days.After wearing it, the other clothes also started to smell bad. I am very very disappointed.;0
887;Too bad!;Product conforms to the photo....but impossible to wear....it smells too much like plastic!!I tried to wash them several times...but this smell of synthetic material remains and very strong too!It's a shame. ... I will never be able to try it!;0
888;VALID PRODUCT BUT SMELLS TERRIBLY;as a product, nothing to say, it does its job, I bought a size m and it's the right size, unfortunately it has an unbearable smell and despite 10 washes already done and a week left out in the fresh air it still stinks terribly. ;0
889; Sauna tank top; good morning, in my opinion they are well made and I actually have to admit that in a short time I lost a good 2 cm of waistline, it doesn't sweat and I feel good, a little annoying in the armpit area and I probably should have taken one size smaller since it gives me the ninth defect in my back but all in all it works or I can easily wear it under my t-shirt. for washing I recommend manual washing, I use a sponge with neutral soap, I wash it almost every day and so far I haven't had any problems.;0
890; Well done but be careful not to overload the heart; the product seems to be of excellent workmanship. It's a nice bodice and it seems to me that the materials used are excellent: after washing it once or twice it releases little odor (which is not common for these materials) and dries quickly. it makes you sweat a lot but then it makes you lose weight... he does it, the problem is that these products are not a miracle anyway... worn without doing anything in my opinion it is useless so to perhaps have some results it would be necessary to use it doing sport, however, involves a dangerous overload on the heart which I do not recommend at all.;0
891; to be avoided; I have been using it for 3 months now, about 3/4 times a week for exercise bikes. Leaving aside the results that I don't see, the real problem with this undershirt is the zip which has been struggling to slide and getting stuck for 2 months now. today in the end the zip completely blocked and the teeth seem to have been eaten and it has taken on a blue color making the undershirt completely unusable.;0
892; Slimming tank top; item as described, arrived on time, the packaging is acceptable, the product is made of neoprene and nylon and is good both in terms of stitching and zip. good fit but I recommend a size smaller to be closer to the skin. the only negative is that it has a strong odor but after a few washes it starts to diminish. I recommend it.;0
893;Unfortunately it smells;good fit and seal. the zipper is well made and very resistant. as well as the material which gives an excellent feeling on the skin. Too bad the smell of rubber is unbearable and doesn't go away even after several washes. unusable;0
894; to this day I regret it and give it up; all these articles are hoaxes. I am currently wearing it 2 hours a day for 3 days a week but already after 3 days I noticed that it was rolling up in the central part due to the heat or, as they say, not sweating I feel it just by going to the gym and doing 15 minutes of cycling then it gets hot from sweating but can they give a more detailed explanation? the written measurements tell you that it is not good to calculate 1 size smaller.. I don't think you should do this..;0
895; Practical and quite warm; compared to another headband I have already purchased, I think it is slightly inferior in terms of heat development. you sweat a little less...perhaps a little too light. but on the other hand it is much more practical with its zip which can be removed and put on in an instant. overall quite satisfied;0
896; Good but... watch out for the sizes; very good tank top for going for a run in the morning after having washed it and aired it to remove some of the smell, it has proven to be a valid ally in helping to reduce sweating. the only comment concerns the size that for me 1 81 for 80 kg the l is very wide.;0
897;Tank top;Neoprene tank top taken especially to stay warm on cold days. the fabric is that of diving suits and actually keeps you warm and also makes you sweat but without a balanced diet and constant physical activity it certainly won't help you lose weight.;0
898;False description.. No neoprene..;produced in elastic polyurethane foam and not in neoprene..neoprene is that of diving suits and is usually not very breathable precisely to allow the skin to sweat and have a slimming sauna effect..this it breathes and doesn't make you sweat.. in the past you had purchased an abdominal band and that was fantastic at a very low price but in neoprene. this shirt is useless..;0
899; Good product but not complete; I've used the shirt several times for running and it does its job by making you sweat a lot. But then I bought another one with a belt and straps on the abdomen. Good thing though, this one can be washed in the washing machine at 30 degrees;0
900; Good quality for the price; the product is very comfortable, I wore it under my clothes and you can't see it, you are doubtful about the purchase but it was very comfortable, excellent value for money, excellent delivery, arrived very quickly, I recommend a really useful purchase.;0
901;Band;I must say that I have been using it for some time now and every day in the gym it does its job, it helps to increase sweating, it clearly needs to be associated with physical activity. It also works with a simple walk. the quality is good especially the very solid zipper. recommended.;0
902; Slimming tank top; very good and quality product. due to the smell you have to leave it in the air for the first few days, however it is bearable then it goes away when washed. I'm 1.8m tall and 90kg overweight. Size XL fits well, slightly tight.;0
903;Like at the petrol station!;The size is generous following the table provided. Unfortunately, after using and washing it 10 times, it still smells very strongly of chemicals... a smell similar to naphtha. really very annoying.;0
904; Right; as described by others, the length is a little too right... I am 172 cm tall and weigh 94 kg.... the fit is good but during physical activity it lifts a little.... all in all good product... delivery on time...;0
905; Item conforms to the description; good quality material, excellent finishing. upon first use the unpleasant smell persists but the problem can be solved by washing properly and leaving to dry in the open air. If I were to buy it again I would take it one size smaller;0
906; good product; the product arrives packaged in a well-kept plastic bag. when wearing it, it feels right on the stomach and hips area but on the chest and shoulders it is wide... thus making it uncomfortable to use under a shirt.;0
907; Not very practical; arrived on time with 1 day shipping, although the box looks a little worn, the contents appear new and never used. inside the package I found the eyelash holder mirror with 4 pairs of eyelashes with magnets and the tweezers to apply them. the instructions are easy and intuitive. I immediately tried to apply them but with a lot of difficulty and the result is not wonderful as they remain straight without following the natural line of the eye so you would have to shape them up a bit by curving them... let's say that on the tenth attempt I managed to put them in the best possible way of my possibilities and I attach a photo of the final result. Of course, the magnets aren't exactly invisible and if you stay straight, the one on the outer corner is a bit too noticeable... I'll have to try the makeup to see if the final result is acceptable. I reserve the right to update my review and in the meantime I hope I have been useful. update: I decided to return the product as I was not satisfied and for my eye they appear to be too large, leaving the side magnets visible, finally I found them too difficult to wear. fail.;0
908;Disheartening;the product itself looks good, I'm also almost sure that if you're used to putting them on it's simple but for someone like me trying it for the first time it's a nightmare :2 I would say that it's absolutely not user friendly! with or without tweezers :(;0
909; No; the eyelashes are simply unusable as the magnets were not glued correctly and do not match between the upper and lower eyelashes. I had to cut the third magnet to make them match and I managed (after exactly an hour and a half) to apply them .it's a shame because in themselves they are well made but they are absolutely not worth the price I paid for them!;0
910; Extender works but does not comply with the technical characteristics; the system would also be useful for moving the HDMI signal to meters if you have this type of need and also very useful is the fact that as well as a pertender it works as a splitter and controls two screens simultaneously ....but it is totally useless.....because the description is totally wrong it talks about being able to extend the signal through a 60 meter long ethernet cable but this is absolutely not true.....I have done various tests and the distance maximum does not exceed 8 meters then the signal decreases in intensity so much so that nothing can be seen anymore.....I am an electrician for my personal proof I have also tested on the bench with both cat 5e cable and cat6 cable with respective cat connectors 6 and the signal does not exceed 8 metres.....so the system is totally useless because 8 meters can be covered at much less cost directly than an HDMI cable makes no sense in something like this....don't absolutely trust the characteristics and of the other reviews the characteristics do not reflect the truth!!!;0
911; more than 30-50 meters only a few meters; as a computer scientist it is very easy for me to find a well-made ethernet cable but even using quality cat 6 cable the product does not work. I have 2 25 meter lan cables that I used for other things but in both the HDMI signal is not transferred between t for and r for. after wasting time changing hdmi cables and network cables I tried connecting the two boxes with a cable a few meters long and it works. I'm sorry, I needed it for at least 20 meters, a feature indicated in the explanations. terrible product;0
912; Some small problems; unlike the other model I bought with this one I had some difficulty getting it to work correctly. I had to use a 30 meter cat.6 cable and set the parameter for longer footage. At 1080 it clicked I had to lower the resolution of my nvr at 720;0
913;They do their job.;They work properly if installed with at least a category 6 cable, better if higher. I tried on 12 meters with a category 5 cable and the image was noisy and the signal was very unstable. Sometimes after prolonged use the TV loses the HDMI signal but it is sufficient to disconnect the power supply from the transmitter device (which also powers the receiver via the LAN cable) and everything goes back to normal. I haven't tried the IR remote control yet. overall, however, their duty is ninth.;0
914;Not recommended;bought to bring the HDMI signal from a PC to a television in another room, despite the length of the Ethernet cable of only 10m the signal did not arrive. tried in various configurations without ever getting the signal, asked for replacement and even the second pair didn't work. not recommended;0
915; IT DOES NOT WORK ON CAT 7 SFTP 25 meters; I decided to spend 41 euros against the classic 22 of cheap adapters but unfortunately this adapter does not work on a category 7 shielded sftp cable of 25 meters length!! connected with a 20cm non-screened patch it works.... stated it works on 60 metres... what a disappointment;0
916;It created problems.;unfortunately it looked good and I had a lot of confidence but after several attempts and changed cables in covering a stretch of only 13m it created quite a few problems. Depending on where I put it, the tea lost its connection. however, the r disturbs the ante ninth of the TV. returned. shame because it worked.;0
917; TV OK but the remote control doesn't work; I use them to watch the Sky signal on one TV coming from the other where the decoder is connected. everything is ok but the Sky remote control doesn't work despite the presence of a specific component. a serious flaw.;0
918; Zero reliability; easy and intuitive installation, perfect image on TV up to a month and a half after purchase, after which it stopped working, the red LED stays on and the display is off. I tried to reset but nothing happened and now I can't even return it. ;0
919;PW-HT225PIR Extender;I purchased this HDMI extender to connect a PS4 to a television about 5 meters away. the connection works quite well but there is a significant delay in the response with an excessive lag;0
920; Let's say sufficient but not Excellent; then first of all it does not transmit the remote control signal but it is only audio and video. I tried it with Sky and unfortunately the result is barely sufficient because for me during viewing sometimes artifacts appear perhaps due to interference.;0
921; Terrible; don't take it. I tried them with a 20m tested and working network cable and they didn't transmit anything!!! with a 1m cable they worked!!! terrible if I wanted to extend the signal by 1m all I had to do was put an HDMI wire!!!;0
922;Salutable and with attention;yes and fantastic immediate effect as you have swelling and weight loss you can see it almost immediately a week later using it every day. I use it every other day, just one pill in the morning. Sometimes I struggle to insert it because it isn't covered and dry. It doesn't slide out easily even though it is small. you should only drink water for perfect effect. People with hemorrhoid problems or hypertension problems should not use them.;0
923; it didn't work on me; I had already used piperine and turmeric although from another company and it had worked very well with this product which was taken between meals when with the other I had to take it just before meals and also with all the other similar products it didn't work at all I didn't find any benefit, especially with physical activity carried out almost every day then the tablets, despite being small, are difficult for me to swallow and stick to my throat perhaps because they are porous. I wasn't satisfied at all.;0
924;It is important that we do not ingest toxic substances;I am finishing the packaging. I have a balanced diet. I do sport 5 days a week. I wanted to make this annoying belly drop. I don't know if the tablets worked. but given the ingredients of the good it will do it ninth. It took me 1 to 9 to drop 3 kg. you have to have consistency. I wish I had more results for pain. pain in knees and back. That's why I do sport. My concern is having read that Amazon has advised against it. I didn't receive anything. This worries me...does anyone have any reliable information?;0
925; Difficult to swallow; unfortunately I was disappointed not so much by the goodness of the product also because it is difficult to understand whether it works or not but rather by the format of the pills which at least as far as I am concerned are often difficult to swallow and I was often choking on them. description 1 to 4 pills are recommended but 1 200mg pill does practically nothing as the body disposes of most of it. I recommend at least 3 pills a day.;0
926;Good;I gave 3 stars not for the product itself which is excellent but I didn't like it because it constantly gives me a stomach ache. what a shame.. it also relieves hunger and would have been an excellent support for diet and weight loss. unfortunately I had to stop. Anyway, Amazon as always is impeccable, fast delivery and intact packaging. but above all made in Italy!;0
927;Money badly spent?;according to an initial report it seems to have no effects. I'll wait a few more weeks and then I'll update the review... the bottle doesn't close the tablets properly, it doesn't taste good and when you take them your fingers turn yellow.;0
928;It doesn't work for me..;I finished a jar but I didn't get any results. I have two more jars....I continue to take it. I hope for the results. I'm currently not happy...it doesn't reflect what was said on the information ;0
929; nothing has changed!; I finished taking pills a day for a month.. nothing has changed! I go to the gym once a week I eat regularly and healthily I walk to work every day and come home at feet...all useless. It's of no use.;0
930; Benefits already after a week;" ""it certainly didn't make me lose weight but I sensed that this wouldn't be easy. I was looking for something else from this product. I take two pills in the morning and two before going to sleep and in fact already in a week I have tried a great benefit with regards to tendons and joints. I no longer have to ""rebuild"" myself when I get up in the morning. Furthermore, the daily routine has gone to mousse level. I feel so good, it's wonderful!""";0
931;Useless;I am preparing to review the product after total consumption of the bottle in the quantities indicated in the instruction booklet. I haven't lost a single gram of weight despite physical activity (1 hour a day every day) and a careful diet. so what? for my useless experience;0
932; Good product; intact packaging, perfect delivery. As far as I'm concerned, the product has an effect, let's say that despite having overindulged a couple of times with food, the scale hasn't suffered too much in terms of its relieving effect. I haven't noticed any major changes from those small joint pains that I usually have. however it is good value for money and on offer I would 100% buy them again;0
933; It is in tablet form without a particular taste; bought because it highlights the properties of turmeric. No particular flavor. I took it for preventive purposes and no. healing .. the flavor is not very perceptible and being tablets it is easy to take .;0
934;TURMERIC+PIPERINE | HIGH DOSAGE; the product arrived in good time and the packaging was in excellent condition. Unfortunately, the product rating is not at all positive. after 3 weeks of daily use my weight did not decrease by even a kilogram even though I followed exactly what was indicated on the package. I dare to say in my opinion that the product is not acceptable for any reason and I do not recommend purchasing it for slimming purposes. greetings.;0
935;Very uncomfortable tablets that stain;I don't know if it worked but that's not the point. I think so, to be honest, in reality, but this is the dilemma of any type of supplement. I do not recommend it due to the complete impracticality of uncoated tablets. they leave a taste in the mouth but that's the least of it. the tragedy is that they stain hands and so on. they are inconvenient to take out of the jar, they fall apart and the yellow powder stained me all over as it came out of the jar. the one that was stained has in turn yellowed all the rest of the laundry in the washing machine;0
936;Good product;I have been taking these tablets for about twenty days and although I cannot say that I have found objective benefits, I must admit that the high concentration can be smelled. It has no return in taste and for me, who used to take honey, turmeric and pepper mixed every day, this solution is much more practical, non-caloric and also has the addition of piperine at a competitive price.;0
937;USELESS!!!;after a month of taking it, I found no effects, I have the same pain as before, in fact now with the weather in this period they have even worsened, I take 4 tablets a day in the evening before going to bed.;0
938;Heartburn only;tried it for two weeks until I couldn't take it anymore. The only result was heartburn immediately after taking it. for the nth time the much advertised remedies are practically useless at least that's how it was for me.;0
939;No benefit;I have been taking these pills for a month combining them with a diet and physical exercise. Unfortunately I don't see any positive affection, in fact I notice that I have constant headaches and stomach swelling. I stopped taking them 4 days ago and I no longer have the symptoms I previously described.;0
940;"No sweat""plus""classics";I gave them to my girlfriend who uses them during cardio training. they are the classic trousers to use to achieve localized weight loss. the good thing is that they are high-waisted. if I have to find a flaw, the price is slightly higher than the Amazon average but still lower than sports stores.;0
941;I still have to use them but..;arrived perfectly packaged.For now I've only tried it on.I'm 171 x 76 tall.I chose 2 perl based on the measurements in the table and the leg is fine, the seat is a little less (tight) huge super wide waist... I think that to avoid losing them on the treadmill I will have to buy a gym belt to put on the waist. I like the material, they are absolutely not noisy like another pair from a well-known brand that I bought noni ago.;0
942;I like them;I use this product when I go running. on the way back when I take off my trousers my legs are wet as if they had just come out of the shower. I didn't measure the cm to see if the thigh circumference has decreased but I certainly expel liquids and toxins.;0
943;Not very satisfied;I don't recommend it because it's too heavy for my tastes. The sizes run small so it's best to take a size up. compared to other similar lighter and more effective products I found it a little disappointing;0
944;Sizes don't match;"I was very sorry to see that the sizes don't match in the slightest. I have a size 42, I ordered the size m but I can't even fit it on. It's definitely too tight, all I had to do was write ""tight fit"" and the person said adjust accordingly without wasting time sending the item back to the sender. so I can't even tell you if it works, we're certainly not there with the sizes.";0
945; Excellent product; I was satisfied with these trousers, they actually don't sweat! It's a lot! I didn't believe it! I use them for about an hour a day and apart from having a very tight leg on my calves I was completely satisfied!;0
946;They do not increase sweating;I do not recommend it except as thermal trousers to wear under jeans or a ski suit. it does not perform the function for which I purchased it: it does not increase sweating even during physical exercise. as regards the sizes, measuring the waistline and hips, the size chart is almost precise. I don't recommend it and I wouldn't buy it again especially for the price.;0
947;Sizes run small.;It's good quality but I couldn't really wear it because it's too small and has little stretch. I weigh 57kg, I'm 1.55m tall and I bought a size M based on the reviews. I think in my case I would need an XL. I will have to proceed with the return.;0
948;Let's not expect miracles;trousers that do not make you sweat during daily activities but only after physical activity or after a walk of at least half an hour, preferably on a sunny day. I wear size 40 and size s fits me!;0
949;So So;based on the reviews I purchased a m. I have a pear-shaped body and they are not entirely high-performance at the waist, they are huge and on the legs they are very tight. for the rest it only makes you sweat if you're moving!;0
950; Ugly and not very functional; the trousers have a horrible shape. Size S for me is quite large especially at the waist and at the knees. perhaps for this reason the level of sweating produced more than normal is practically non-existent.;0
951; Good purchase, pay attention to the size; I'm 177 cm tall and have a size 42 but very long legs. I bought a size L today and they arrived and I did about 3 hours of pylates with the leggings. As for the size, it's fine for me because I was able to pull them up well so as not to have a low crotch. I think that if I had taken a medium size they would have been short crotch for me. The material is totally odorless and soft. It didn't make me sweat both on my stomach and on my thighs. it therefore seems that they do their job well.;0
952;I think a size larger is better;unfortunately I had to send the product back because it didn't match my size. I usually take a s/m and I was advised to take a s. that's what I did but by putting them on they barely reach above the knee and beyond that it doesn't fit. so I think I'll take an L. if it is wide in other places it will mean that I will tighten them with the sewing machine. As a product it seemed good to me but I will be able to judge definitively once I have purchased the new pair.;0
953; Perfect fit; the item also arrived before the expected date which is always a welcome thing. the product corresponds to the online description and the quality/price ratio is very good. I have been looking for some sauna effect leggings for a long time that were at the same time very tight-fitting and comfortable for practicing fitness: they often have a velcro band on the waist which prevents certain movements and it stiffens a lot. these are thin but effective;0
954; Nice;" ""fabric seems to be of quality. I haven't yet worn it to go out and the sauna effect even though I still took a smaller size after returning a larger size ordered previously, the waistband fits a little on me wide all the same... the seam between the waistband and the legs is at a height that makes it seem like I have some """"flab""""... but if I use it with long, loose t-shirts it's not noticeable. 185cm tall and 65kg it doesn't fit me too short like most standard trousers.""";0
955; Let's hope so; 4 stars for trust. - arrived 3 days earlier than expected. - trousers exactly as described. - I've been wearing them for three hours, my skin is definitely smoother but no sweat for the moment. - I'm tall (short ) 1 50 cm and weight 59 kg;0
956;Not bad but needs improvement;quite comfortable, the only flaw is that it retains sweat inside. I think you should get a smaller size as mine doesn't fit perfectly. I don't think it makes you lose weight but it's still comfortable for playing sports or going for a walk and goes perfectly with everything. the seams are well made, they do not pull and are resistant.;0
957;Bad quality and practically unwearable;I strongly advise against purchasing them because the leggings are really very heavy and difficult to wear. it will definitely make you sweat but keeping it on for more than 30 seconds is already a record. Plus it doesn't have an elastic waistband so it's not supportive.;0
958;Leaves the skin very soft;according to the size chart for my waist circumference I should have taken a size M for the hip circumference a L..I mediated and took a size M.. the leggings are larger, a S was enough and left over because during the exercise goes down and in any case the waist is really large.. beyond this it is very elastic, good fabric and leaves very soft skin. of course it should be used during physical activity if it is not a normal leggings. obviously it doesn't make you lose weight, don't take it with this intent because miracles happen with diet and physical activity. but it is an excellent ally for the legs! I recommend it but take a size smaller;0
959; Sauna effect; leggings do not do what they promise and that is they make you sweat! I don't know if this helps you lose weight.. I should therefore know that since they don't perspire I wouldn't use them for sport but to keep them on normally even to do free body exercises it's not very good because in case you have to place your knees on the ground you slide inside. I bought a size M after reading reviews that recommended a size up but I would get them in size S because they don't fit me a little big.;0
960; With 32GB after 5 hours of recording the card is full; overall it's not bad, it does the job and the video quality is quite good in a room with lots of light, if there is little light the quality drops drastically. It goes unnoticed without a doubt and personally I found it quite simple to use. The biggest problem in my opinion is the video format, which saves it in uncompressed AVI, or in other words, 10 minutes of video takes up 1GB. with the largest supported card, i.e. the 32GB one, you can have around 5 hours of recording before the card is full, at which point the older files are overwritten. considering this and considering that the motion detection mode is not perfect, this microcamera is not good for keeping an eye on a room when you are absent for more than half a day;0
961;INSTRUCTIONS IN ITALIAN? NO!; they arrived as expected, I took 3 of them inside the box there are even double pieces there is a USB stick which I don't know what it's for there's a pin like the one for smartphones which I don't know what it's for. if the instructions were in Italian maybe I would also know these things and also how to adjust the date and time. however, easy to operate, very intuitive, detects movement well, excellent videos and excellent audio, shame about the missing instructions!;0
962;Product did not last long;unfortunately it only lasted a week then it no longer worked and I only noticed it when I went to see the recordings which stopped 6 days after the first recording I tried to change the memory plug but alas it seems dead in because even the front LED doesn't turn on as soon as you plug it in...30 down the drain.;0
963;They sell you the moon but in fact it's just a photo of the moon;hi, I bought two of these objects and I've been going crazy for a long time but in the end I gave up, they don't work or neither of them is true, it doesn't have the function of charging the phone and it's not true that they record it only has red or blue lights that come on when the object is inserted into the socket otherwise everything is false and I'm right because it's not just one that's wrong but they're both that It has nothing of what is written and proposed in the sale. I'm sorry that more than a few days have passed since the purchase and in any case I ask for a refund because it is not possible to do things so I advise Amazon to take action.;0
964;Move on...;and the ninth spy camera with mediocre characteristics...they declare a viewing angle of 90 degrees and maybe it's not even 45...what do you do with a camera that frames a third of the room if that's okay ? Also the USB charger works terribly. if someone decides to use it after 5 minutes they unplug it because the charging is very slow. not recommended... started the return immediately;0
965; for the price you shouldn't expect but....; it was obvious that the price couldn't coincide with perfect vision in full HD. aware of the risk because when I had to buy a camera that respected the characteristics I spent hundreds of euros I took it because even that little was enough for me in this circumstance. let's say that it would only be enough to include in the characteristics that it has a resolution similar to an avi movie and that if there is no light you can see little or nothing.;0
966;It's awful!;I tried this hidden camera at first. impact seems to be the best but it is uncomfortable for the. taken they are all vertical and therefore the vision is upside down. the sounds are disturbed and unclear, the night vision does not exist and during the day it becomes grainy. not speaking of the file format which is not easily recognized and despite using other players such as vlc it does not load the file quickly and it keeps crashing. I don't recommend it.;0
967;It doesn't work;I bought one that worked for a week and then it started working randomly. I returned it and after a period of reflection I thought I'd try to get another one thinking that I was just unlucky with the first one. the latter records worse than the former for three minutes and then overdubs all the previous recordings. what can I say other than that either I'm unlucky or this product is really poor.;0
968; Excellent quality/price ratio.; The product complies with what was declared. in motion detection mode it is greatly affected by the size of the moving subject and based on how illuminated it is, let's say that in average conditions it detects movement at around two metres. In my opinion, the shooting angle is the real flaw of this camera, being around 45°. the images are good even if recording in uncompressed avi creates very large files but I realize that for the price at which this product is sold you cannot expect much more. in short, an object with an excellent quality/price ratio.;0
969;It detects movement only a few centimeters away. Very short shots.;Tested for a week it doesn't detect any movement especially in low light. she captures very brief moments the few times she detects movement, that is, just a few centimeters away. completely the opposite of what is described in reviews and instructions. returned.;0
970; Excellent value for money; does its job very well except for night vision for which it is not enabled as it does not have infrared. intuitive to use. package complete with everything necessary for later viewing of the videos on the micro SD. Too bad the plug isn't rotatable. you remain forced into the grip position. recommended to those who need it.;0
971;Good;the product works well. the only flaw is that the objective is macro. therefore it brings the images very close and not having a large angle the shots should be taken more than 2m from the lens. the package arrived open like the product packaging. it already seemed to be discarded. I'm not returning it as it works well;0
972; It does its job; obviously we are talking about a cheap product so don't have high expectations especially in video quality. However, it does the job. The only major flaw is that it must always be connected to the power supply (it does not have its own internal battery);0
973;Return requested. It only worked once.;used once and that was it: it looked great. perfect video, very clear audio. however, once connected to the socket it records continuously and once the space on the SD runs out it begins to overwrite. the problem is that then it started I don't know how to demagnetize any sd card. made the return.;0
974;Which is of no use!!!;the plugs have nine vertical poles and the camera is horizontal by inserting it and the image stands out flipped by 90*. the possibility of rotating the prongs to adapt to the sockets should be offered. at night it does not record in the dark it is not true that once the maximum capacity has been reached the recording continues overlapping with the less recent one and therefore it is useless.;0
975; Poor; the package and the product appear as if they had already been used. comparing it with the other reviews and with the sponsored product it would seem like a different model and the SD card is missing;0
976;I wouldn't take it again;the camera is well made and makes good quality videos but each video lasts 5 minutes but the real flaw is that every day it overwrites the previous day's files. basically if you stay out for 2 days and thieves break in on the first day you will only have the videos of the second day... absurd especially considering that it supports SD cards up to 32 gigabytes!!!!;0
977;Works well;really a nice little toy. works well, sufficient audio, good video quality. The shape of the charger with USB pass through is nice and allows camouflage in the environment of use. At the moment I have not detected any particular problems in use. advice!;0
978; Decent product; good small size of the product. good image in daylight. the possibility of recording in the dark does not exist. the motion sensor is good as it is not too sensitive nor too lazy.. just right. The recording audio is also good.;0
979;Limited;viewing angle much lower than the one declared.so in a small room it doesn't frame much of the surface.also it only works well if the socket is horizontal (in my house they are all vertical!);0
980;Does its job;I must say that the ease of installation and the excellent value for money makes me quite satisfied with the purchase. certainly don't expect fantastic images during filming but I repeat they are acceptable compared to the price. for the rest it is easily confused with a common cell phone battery charger;0
981;It's worth nothing!;the motion sensor doesn't work, the Italian double-pass sockets are all vertical and consequently the outlet is at 90° and there is no way to rotate it if inserted into a universal socket (two-pass + shuko) not having a round casing it is difficult to insert.;0
982; camera angle; I would say everything according to expectations except that the camera angle is not well specified. from the photos it seems that there are some with a wide angle and a narrower angle but nothing is specified in the descriptions so how should we be able to distinguish during the purchase phase? I wanted the wide angle ones I bought and they arrived with a fairly narrow angle.;0
983;Dissatisfied;after a few months I cannot be very satisfied with this purchase. the camera records badly (certainly not HD) and furthermore I never find the recording of the entire period despite a 16 GB memory and not even half an hour of recording. divert to something else;0
984;For a spy camera, not having night vision is a major handicap...;I was not able to fully test this product however it detects movement when you are very close...then it absolutely does not have night vision which is not specified in the features..good idea of not always having to recharge since it connects to the socket directly;0
985; DOES ITS DUTY; the video quality is good in optimal light conditions while in the presence of poor visibility the shots leave something to be desired. overall it is worth the money spent also because at this price it is difficult to find a hidden cam with these characteristics.;0
986; Poor video camera; I wanted to try this camera even though other reviews had already said that the shooting angle was not as wide as described and unfortunately I had to agree with it. Very small angle with the active movement function does not always turn on, it must be said that for this price we couldn't expect much more;0
987;Do not purchase;small and discreet item. I was amazed by the quality of both the videos and the quality of the microphone. I've been using it for over a week and haven't had any problems. Unfortunately it didn't work after that. object to avoid since there is better on the market. incorrect seller since he did not want to resolve the issue amicably;0
988;Not bad;"I bought it out of curiosity and I must admit that I don't use it completely"" as one of the 4 functions bothers me. In any case, once a week after a facial sauna I use the first function to remove dead cells and blackheads and I must say that it really removes them! It certainly doesn't work miracles but it's fun to use and it's a good alternative to classic facial cleansing.""";0
989; Waste of money; not suitable for sensitive skin. I have the coupe rose and apart from making my whole face red it has no use, it doesn't even remove dirt and blackheads and the instructions are unclear. the most useless purchase in history as far as I'm concerned.;0
990;DISAPPOINTED! they are not what they seem; the item is totally different from what it looks like in the photo. in reality they are just metallic pe nons without double lines or glitter. I didn't return them because my daughter liked them as they were a surprise for her. but this way to act is highly incorrect. disappointed!;0
991;Cute.;Shake and press tip for first use. the colored outline comes out in different quantities depending on the ace of the card. on normal paper the outline is a very thin line if you try it on a paper napkin the colored outline can reach 3-4 mm.. however they are very beautiful. the total thickness is not very wide on normal paper but I would say that they are very effective .;0
992;What a disappointment, they are used;the product has arrived but some of them have already been used and you can see it because when they are new they all have the white part. definitely if I had to buy them again I wouldn't take them from this supplier;0
993;Only two work;only two work or the red or the blue, the others are normal, for example, pencils with a large tip. It's a shame because those two are very beautiful, maybe it's a pigment problem, maybe the other colors don't take metallic well;0
994;They are beautiful and they work;my enthusiastic daughter had never seen double-ended pencils and she tried them immediately as soon as they arrived, they all worked and we got them on black cardboard.For now nothing to criticize.Recommended;0
995;It's not always good to save money.;For a long time my iPhone 7 had only a few hours of battery life. with this battery it was completely regenerated. easy to assemble, I saw it on YouTube and I succeeded (very simple). in 20 minutes and a little patience you can do it. quick and easy you just need to be careful but it's very easy. before I had the battery status at 70% and now at 100%. I highly recommend it;0
996; iPhone 7 battery 📱 ; excellent quality battery supplied with all mounting accessories including stickers. The battery has a higher capacity than the original and has a maximum capacity of 100%, which I have not found in other batteries purchased for the duration. to spend more than a whole day depending on how I use the phone. rating 10;0
997; Correct contents, just sufficient performance; the contents of the package are rich but the problem is that the battery, despite being significantly more powerful than the original, lasts exactly as long as the first one. I am not at all satisfied and I hope the situation improves as the charging cycles go by.;0
998; Terrible, terrible case; very low quality case yes the price is what it is but the case is shapeless the lower part has a different shape from that of the headphone holder and always slips off the upper part no because it has a sticker that has removed the Samsung writing from the headphone holder. not to mention how much dust that particular rubber attracts, a really bad purchase, I think you can find something better, perhaps spending 5-6 more;0
999; GOOD COVER, LOW QUALITY CARABINER; cover of a beautiful color and fits quite well on the headphones but unfortunately the charging LED of the headphones is covered by a waste membrane which is easily removed with scissors while the carabiner is of low quality quality in fact does not close well risking the headphones falling;0
1000;I expected more...;I had chosen this because it seemed to cover the back perfectly too but like other competitors this is not the case, something remains visible. The adhesive for the case cover is not too strong and I managed to reposition it after having put it on without centered without losing the adhesive power although I fear it will come apart in the summer with sand and salt... in any case the cover doesn't fit as elegantly as in the photo but that's fine. the hook supplied, however, is badly damaged after a few uses and now it no longer closes and needs to be replaced... the material of the cover has a tendency to bind to lint. I don't have a wireless charging system so I can't say anything about it. everything overall a good product but I expected something more.;0
1001; Good but not excellent; it adheres well to the bud box but as it is made of rubber, anything sticks to it and even a single stick is noticeable, furthermore if you continually rub a pocket or bag with other objects the back part took very little time to break but excluding this I would say that it is very good even with the broken rear tire it holds up very well;0
1002; Too light, I expected it to be more fruity and persistent; oil is something sacred for us Italians. I expected much more... also considering the higher cost compared to the others. It may not be personal taste but you have to taste the oil. From the other reviews I see that they write the same.;0
1003; very bad; it arrived on time and ok, it was very dirty as if it had already been used by someone else. I returned it since it didn't work well, the flow of steam was often interrupted, I don't know if it was due to a malfunction or because the nozzle was dirty from the inside and was clogged, but the fact is that it had to be shaken continuously for continuous use.;0
1004; Defective product; returned after 2 days of use as it loses liquid even if held vertically and placed on the work surface near the facial treatment table. It's a shame because the nebulization was fine. too bad...I give one star.;0
1005;Good but not very good...;bought to open the pores after cleansing the face.unfortunately it is uncomfortable the steam stops after a few seconds you have to shake it a bit to continue the flow.I give 3 stars anyway for the quick delivery.;0
1006; After a week the battery does not hold up; after just one week of use the battery, even at maximum charge, does not hold more than 15 minutes of playback. Furthermore, the audio is also not the best, low volume and above all a dangerous suction cup effect is created by removing them from the auricle it could be done to the eardrum.;0
1007; Audio a little poor but comfortable and with an excellent battery; good cheap earphones. The batteries last for many hours and the range and stability of the Bluetooth are also excellent. The audio is not the best but in on the other hand, the microphone works well. It has good stability in the ears and the package contains numerous rubber tips to best adapt. I found the large rubber that fits to the auricle very uncomfortable for my ear but as can be seen from the photo it can remove without problems. to date I only attach it when I go for a run and in that case, as uncomfortable as it is, it makes it practically impossible to lose the earphone;0
1008; Poor audio NOT FOR MUSIC otherwise good product.; audio worthy of Chinese headphones costing a few euros. Audio quality test evidently absent. With an equalizer you can save something but I don't recommend them for music, unobtainable medium bass that dominates like a megaphone. they are very comfortable otherwise. Sin. update: I found the mpow s10 (swallowed by the sofa) did some 1:1 tests the audio quality is generally similar to simple listening but just put on music with bass and the mpow easily win both for the low frequencies and for the highest volume . I tried to put smaller rubbers and fit them well but they don't reach the simply placed mpows. to get similar performance I have to use an inconvenient software equalizer though. for calls in my opinion they are very valid, very comfortable, perfect Bluetooth. definitely not 4.5 star headphones considering that I paid less for the mpows and they are better. I would say maximum 3.5. I leave 2 stars to balance the excessively positive reviews. ps: I discovered that au chey and mpow were withdrawn due to fake reviews I think the phenomenon is much more widespread maybe even some reviews here....;0
1009;Good Bluetooth headphones, excellent quality/price ratio;excellent impression when opening the package, perfect packaging, box wrapped in film, earphones and charging cable inside a small bag, instructions and several earplugs, the two earphones can be joined together when not in use a magnet. the audio is acceptable I would say good I use them mainly for calls in the car or on public transport and I hear well. I would like to find headphones that have a slightly higher volume but not wanting to spend these are an excellent compromise!;0
1010;Not bad but if you want more you have to pay more;bought because I had to replace two other headphones, one of which I unfortunately lost and which sounded great. what can I say compared to the last ones that I had hastily purchased and quickly returned because they were horrible in sound, these ones I have to say that they are good, certainly we shouldn't think of high level headphones in terms of sound, let's say that they do their job without infamy and without praise, built well, good cable not too thin. rating 6/7;0
1011;Bad bad;very bad I'm disappointed and I don't often leave a negative review. the headphones constantly lose connection with the cell phone's Bluetooth even during phone calls. plus the vocals feel tinny and sometimes incomprehensible. It's a shame because the construction seemed good to me and the materials used for the silicone headphones seem equally good.;0
1012;Does its job;I have other bluetooth earphones, the small ones that fit inside those little boxes that if you're not careful you lose them in two seconds. I wanted something to use on a daily basis. I think I found them. one aspect that I would like to highlight, however, is that it has that silicone tab which should fit somewhere in the auricle and which I have not yet identified for sure... . in my opinion they are not for ru noner but for work or to listen to music in peace. The small magnet that joins them when not in use is handy. price not exactly cheap but in line with the quality and competitors.;0
1013;I expected something better when listening to music;the headset seems to have good materials. I haven't been able to test the battery life yet. I have to use it for work and when I do sports (running and cycling). the interlocutor says he hears well (in a closed environment). I was a little disappointed by the sound when listening to music (especially the bass). I come from mpow and au chey earphones which had a much better sound in this area. I'm not an audiophile but I'm passionate about music and I like to hear it well: if this were only their use I would return them and I reserve the right to do some other tests.;0
1014; After a few months defective - TOP battery; after a ninth of use: let's start with the advantages: ergonomics accessories battery life at the top defects: little power the volume at maximum is comparable to 70% of the others on the market (previously I had taotronics ) after about 8 months of use the right earphone lost power, it sounds at 50% of the left earphone.. no settings solved the problem encountered with various devices. for this reason 2 stars, too bad.;0
1015; DURATION 32 DAYS; after 32 days of use, a couple of hours a day during physical activity it starts to whistle and emit metallic interference, effectively becoming unusable for both listening to music and having conversations. The product looks good, nice package, good battery for the rest in the norm for this range, shame about the duration, perhaps I was unlucky...;0
1016; Poor quality; I would like to start by saying that I would have liked to avoid a more significant expense and I was wrong from the beginning when I decided to buy a pair of Bluetooth headphones and all the returns I made including the latter and the time wasted making the returns would have (and I will do it immediately) purchased the pro air pods!!! let's get to the latter: short cable for me as I have a slightly more accentuated neck, the earphone reaches just right to the ear....but it has difficulty entering the pavilion as the hooks (although made of soft silicone) prevent a quick adaptation to the conformation of my ear and after a few minutes the pain begins. However, I wanted to try listening to the music first and here I would like to know how it rated in other 5-star reviews which are fantastic... meh! not to mention the volume I was listening to during the call: low (despite having my iPhone at maximum) and a distant voice. On the other hand, listening to my interlocutor was positive as he didn't know I was speaking to him through a headset. final result: collected at 6.39pm and returned at 7.47pm. be careful when purchasing!!;0
1017; excessive price for the quality of the product.; the only positive note in my opinion is the battery life, the sound in the earphone capsules does not excel in quality but in my opinion it could have been better and also the electric cable that connects the two earphones it could have been 5 cm. longer the microphone quality during a call (saying the interlocutor) is good. in the end I could have kept them too bad that two weeks after purchasing the right earphone decided to lower its sound power by around 70% I have always used the headphones impeccably they have never fallen or anything else I don't use them for do sports for which you have not received particles or droplets of sweat. I'm finally returning them.;0
1018; Excellent; good product and good value for money. it feels good but above all it hears well who is on the other end of the phone. For now I have not yet been able to verify the actual battery life but in any case I am satisfied and will keep it in mind for another purchase;0
1019;Not even used 3 times and they break;second charge and they melt making a big smell of burnt plastic in the charging plug using the supplied cable. now they are completely compromised I can no longer recharge them. they weren't even a month old. I kindly request a replacement pair. The product is not up to the price I paid. I expected better. I kindly request that the company contact me to resolve the problem and that they are kindly replaced. I didn't expect the review to be so ignored. very disappointed.;0
1020;BAD SOUND RIDICULOUS;returns terrible sound, they disconnect after a few minutes and during phone calls the audio quality unexpectedly worsens. the microphone transmits a crackling voice. when listening to the songs the sound distorts already at half volume, lacks body and depth.;0
1021;Change review…;edit: I now give 4 stars for the seller who was very helpful and sent other headphones. I await their arrival and hope they are of better quality. the battery doesn't last even half an hour on the left side you can't hear it at all and on the right it makes a strange noise. I advise against the purchase. I would give 0 stars but unfortunately it's impossible.;0
1022; Purchase valid based on the type of use you want to make of it; in short, for those who want to have earphones with which to make calls in which our interlocutor does not complain about the quality of the voice, this product is for you. on the other hand, listening to music is just decent with non-existent bass. so I would give 4 stars for the telephony functions and 2 for the musical audio quality.;0
1023;Discreet but unfortunate; they died just over a month after purchase: I try to turn them on and a constant and deafening beep sounds, I turn them off to never turn back on again. The battery life seemed excellent and they paired very quickly with the smartphone. As far as sound quality goes, I've had better earphones for the same price or less.;0
1024;Finally some bluetooth headphones with a working microphone;after several attempts I finally found some bluetooth headphones which, in addition to making me hear phone calls well, make my interlocutor hear my voice well (if there is no background noise).I can also keep them connected to my mobile phone and my PC at the same time, switching from video calls to phone calls without having to dj with the settings. So-so autonomy, in short, the best I've found to date. recommended update for three weeks but the right side feels much lower than the left and my interlocutors find it difficult to hear me due to the low volume. It's a shame. movie lasted a very short time.;0
1025;Uncomfortable Bluetooth headphones.;I have used and still use other similar headphones. compared to previous models, the cable that connects the two earphones is rigid. add to this that the button panel is bulky, probably to guarantee greater autonomy by housing larger batteries. if you move and your head and neck don't stay aligned, the headphones continue to fall.;0
1026;Very low. I recommend other headphones; I ordered these headphones because the previous ones broke and are no longer on sale here on Amazon. I paid about 10 euros more for these but they feel very cheap. poor bass.impeccable courier!;0
1027;Item malfunctions;the microphone of this product does not work well. people tell me they feel sick with difficulty and sometimes very metallic so much so that I have to deactivate them. It's a shame because the product itself seemed of unusable quality to me. I will arrange for your return;0
1028; Poor sound; metallic sound that cannot be corrected even by working on the equalizer. Low volume even in phone calls as well as music, strong distortion. Very fragile general appearance. Compared to other cheap headphones I have, these are even worse. Unjustified price;0
1029; Excellent feedback from the seller; after less than a month the right earphone feels very low. I was contacted by the seller who verified the problem and offered to replace the product. Excellent management of the issue.;0
1030;Broken after a month;initially I was enthusiastic about the product, the battery life is excellent, the audio quality is good, the headphones are quite comfortable. in short, 5 stars.;0
1031; Poor bass; headphones to be used for phone calls or watching TV. for listening to music they don't convince me at all. the bass is almost absent. I expected a little more reading the various reviews.;0
1032;A filament for resistant and elastic prints;"I could define PETG as resilient"""" a very fashionable word in these days, it is a middle ground between PLA (very easy to print but often fragile) and ABS (complicated to print but extremely resistant). Let me start by saying that I have an Anycubic i3 Mega S. What changes? This particular filament requires small adjustments to the temperature of the nozzle and the print bed. There is no perfect temperature for each PETG ( as is often not the case for all platters) it must be tested from time to time, however, it is enough to know that it must be printed between 230 and 250 degrees and a printing plane that can make it adhere properly cannot stay below 70 degrees As far as I'm concerned, after some research and tests I set the slicer's printing profile with 230 degrees for the extruder, 80 for the plate and finally I also adjusted the fan... but we'll talk about it later. stringing and boiling are the main problem I found, especially in the first prints in which I tested the various settings, a rather significant stringing, naturally accentuated precisely in those models in which the nozzle had to move several times between high and distant parts. I managed to reduce it as much as possible by resetting the fan during printing which evidently cooled the filament too quickly, keeping a small part of it """"attached"""" to the nozzle which then moved by pulling it. In addition I was able to observe a widespread although not massive presence of superficial bubbles which, however, manage to come away easily even with light pressure, leaving the surface intact. both of the aforementioned problems never disappeared completely but they still became very limited once the printer was set up properly""";0
1033;Very fragile but is it really PETG?;"I'll start by saying that my review is for the black color of this filament. I purchased several spools of pla from geeetech and I've never had any problems, this makes it difficult for me to write this review. We're really talking of petg? two identical prints same parameters (net of temperature) one in black pla and one in black petg (this one) both geeetech. the pla was harder and more difficult to break the petg broke with a little pressure from the fingers.. I tried to change the printing parameters a thousand times, heck at the beginning I couldn't even get it to stick I had to lower the offset by a few millimeters to make it ""engrave"" better on the plate (not glass). when I finally managed to make this filament adhere to the plate all the prints that came out were terrible: stringing oozing entire lines missing the head completely dirty very fragile prints. at the beginning I thought they were my parameters or my printer but printing a white PETG of another brand no problem so... maybe it was a ""faulty coil"" I like to think so. I'm sorry but this is a complete failure.";0
1034; Excellent product; good material for those who are starting to enter the world of 3D printing. Compared to the classic pla it certainly has better mechanical and heat resistance, the printability however remains the same as easy as the pla. Inside the package it is there is also a practical airtight bag to store the filament away from humidity. the only flaw is excessive stringing which can certainly be resolved easily. excellent adhesion, no problems even with a bed that is not perfectly levelled.;0
1035;Too much post processing;"the filament paid ""little"" but it wasn't worth it in fact the filament leaves a lot of threads (I tried everything: retraction up to 8mm coasting wipe etc) and a lot of post-processing is needed.come resistance is fine also the accuracy in the diameter of the wire is within the declared limits.";0
1036;Not among the best PETG but still excellent for quality/price;I bought this filament mainly for the attractive price and it turned out to be quite good but the quality of the material is not the best if you are looking for resistance and maximum adhesion of the layers. the printed pieces are less solid than I expected.;0
1037; Characteristics not of PETG; filament with characteristics very far from a real PETG, just touching it with a little pressure breaks. leaving aside that to print it I had to set temperatures at 250 extruder and 90 plate.;0
1038;Good petg. Excellent grip; good product, it takes a while to find the right setting. it must be printed hot and slow but the result is excellent. it lines up a little like the whole petg. the black is shiny and silky. fabulous adherence to the plate.;0
1039; PETG green difficult but ok; it took me a while to get good results but in the end I managed to print it. the first problem is the impossibility of obtaining bridges and I couldn't even print the crossed zig zag filling. I solved it by activating the ventilation and I am therefore forced to keep it on. The second problem is the excessive leakage of material on the edges, creating those annoying swellings that created problems for me for the type of project I was printing. I tried varying the temperatures and activating linear advance from the firmware but I didn't like the results. therefore I had to act on the jerk, which I didn't want to do given the lack of robustness of the printer. but I still solved it (more or less) like this. Third problem it still doesn't stick to glass if I don't apply at least a drizzle of lacquer. Fourth problem is the stringing but it's the characteristic of PETG so it's there. Overall the rating isn't bad because I got away with using a little more head, the color faithfully complies with the description and the strength/adhesion between the layers did not disappoint me. In the photo there are some sharp edges that I printed as a test to point out that with the jerk at 30 mm/s, all in all it didn't do a bad job. good prints!;0
1040; first PETG with alfawise u30 pro;" ""I have used and continue to use many types of filament, including those from other brands. Greetech's PLA is a """"safe haven"""" easy to print with good adhesion, excellent print quality and mechanical characteristics that do not absolutely makes me regret more expensive and ""designer"" filaments. Highly recommended!""";0
1041; Power q20 pro headphones; just tested but it seems in line with my expectations. It looks premium and well looked after. The sound is good at least for the type of in-ear headphones. The system messages are not very audible in my opinion. you need to find the right ear tips for your ear canal so that the sound pressure is adequate but at the expense of the perception of external noises so be careful when using them on a bike or for jogging as you would be isolated from the world :). pairing with the my note10+ and also with the gala pery watch but not with both at the same time (you need to redo the pairing). the charging base has a small display that shows the percentage of battery remaining but I don't think it can act as a power bank. 4 stars and not 5 because the seller's policy pushes the review with the promise of a shopping voucher and this... leads to overestimation. the product is good for the price range and should not be sponsored in this way.;0
1042;Good for the price but....;"I bought these earphones because I needed headphones to go running while I was on holiday, mine stopped working. I normally don't listen to music but podcasts. The pros were :- the battery is very long - the case shows the percentage of charge of its battery and with LEDs the charge of the single earphone - satisfactory audio for the price. but I listen to podcasts for music they don't seem very balanced - volume with buttons on both earphones. I think it's very convenient that they are not touch-sensitive. - once the position has been found, they stay firm there is no risk of them falling. - they do not isolate from the surrounding environment. Cons: - the material of the case and earphones is made of ""cheap"" plastic, for 25 euros anyway... - the instructions are written in a very small font that is barely readable. - the earphones speak like all those of this type but you can't understand what they are saying it seems English but with a pronunciation incomprehensible. at the moment I was only able to understand the power on"" - the other indications were not - the left earphone tends to lose connection. it happened to me about 50% of the outputs (at the moment about twenty) sometimes it recovers it on its own but sometimes you have to turn it off and on again near the mobile phone. very cons: - the volume keys """"dance"""" a bit. when you walk or ride a bike there are no problems but when running you feel them hitting their seat with every leap so you continue to hear: stec stec stec stec with every step. after the first 100 meters I wanted to throw them straight away then I tried positioning the earphones differently, it only manages to reduce the problem, making it almost bearable but not eliminating the problem. I'm considering whether to give them back or try some type of hack. in summary: ok for everything but not for running.""";0
1043;Defective product;I guess I was unlucky. I purchased these headphones at a discounted price via Amazon warehouse, convinced by the good reviews and the many testimonials that presented them as excellent earphones with good noise cancellation. in my case the only thing that was canceled was my voice: my interlocutors always said that they felt distant at a very low volume while even the slightest surrounding noise (such as my own steps) was deafening. and honestly I didn't find them that comfortable: ok I have a strange left ear (I can't use in-ear earphones due to an anomalous shape) but after just 20 minutes I already had pain... in the right ear which would be the one normal. disappointed very disappointed. obviously I will return them.;0
1044; after 3/4 months they no longer charge; I have purchased these headphones twice because they are comfortable, the sound is discreet and they don't cost much. However, the problem is always the same. after 3/4 months from their purchase with a weekly use of 3/4 days for 1 hour of running they begin to experience problems with charging. the first few times or moments in which they recharge or others in which the charging does not start and then dies completely. It's a shame because as a product it's not bad but the duration is really limited.;0
1045;Donerton T12 - Defective right headset or right side magazine? Only hypotheses.; the headphones in question delivered to me a few hours ago by the Amazon courier unfortunately have a serious defect which I personally am not able to identify but can only hypothesize. the article in question which although aesthetically and structurally well made and of very large dimensions contained does not allow me to perform normal pairing. In fact, pairing with the smartphone occurs quickly but only with the left earphone while the right, despite every useful attempt and following the seller's instructions for resetting them, does not show any sign of life so it does not pair either with the left earphone or consequently with the cell phone. as if it were completely non-existent. I would like to point out that before proceeding with charging and subsequent pairing with the mobile phone, I removed the tiny films covering the contacts located at the base of each earphone.;0
1046; Bluetooth headphones; update 08/10/2021 after writing the original review (the one below) I managed to find a way to recharge the faulty headphones using paper shims to hold them in place. unfortunately the problem recurred the same for the other headphones. furthermore, after a while the volume buttons on one of the headphones no longer worked and furthermore there were continuous disc failures (continuous power on and power off). for a couple of days the headset has been practically blocked with both the red and blue lights flashing continuously and there is no way to turn it off or put it on the phone... conclusion: I threw everything away. Terrible purchase not to be missed. never repeat again...******************************************** ****************************initially immediately after purchase I must say that I was quite satisfied with it: decent audio quality, ease of use and good Incoming and outgoing audio quality during phone calls seemed more than satisfactory when compared to the purchase price (25 euros). Unfortunately my satisfaction with this purchase didn't last long. in fact, after just over a month of use a very annoying problem arose. in practice one of the two headphones (the left) does not make good contact when placed in the charging box so it constantly attaches and detaches and does not recharge. you have to waste half an hour to find a stable enough position so that the headphones can turn off and go on charging. naturally this problem also makes it impossible to transport it for example in a bag because the cap could easily lose contact with the tips and therefore be activated and deactivated continuously. which is why I do not feel like recommending this product and I will contact Amazon directly as soon as possible to find a solution to the problem.;0
1047;Comfortable but not working after only 10 days;the headphones are comfortable and feel relatively good for their price but after about ten days one of the two headphones stopped working. Both, like the base, are charged but there is no way to make it work despite being connected to the phone. Unfortunately I will pass on the return, which is a real disappointment more than anything else because in terms of comfort in the ears they are excellent. but after just ten days they cannot stop working.;0
1048;Not to buy;but please 26 thrown away I bought them to go running and they didn't work well only 3 times in the last few days they were disconnected and they don't work together anymore or the d for or the s for but there's no way to make them work together. The saying that those who spend more spends less is true! now I will have to look for a serious and certainly more expensive product but it will be worth it rather than these rip-offs!!!;0
1049; verified purchase; half satisfied, however, I recommend the purchase even if you shouldn't expect many demands. I'll start by saying that the voice connection to access calls or with the telephone assistant is missing... the headphones answer you in Chinese and if someone he calls you he only tells you the number in English and he doesn't even give you his name...sometimes I find myself in a noisy environment and you understand the environmental disturbance well unfortunately so it's not that great...the music doesn't have great effects and the bass sometimes barely perceptible in the end not having the but for an exaggerated volume and also pleasant to listen to... it connects quickly and well to the phone plus it maintains contact very well I only use one headphone at a time for work reasons and I must say that the battery is excellent headphones used 1 at a time for 11 days with daily production from 5 to 7 hours plus the charging time takes place in 2 hours... aesthetically comfortable and perfect, light also to carry, it has some flaws as described First of all, however, I am partially satisfied with the use I make of it.;0
1050; decent product but they have a flaw if used for sports; the earphones are nice, comfortable and cheap and the music doesn't sound bad. I only use them for running and that's where they have a flaw: the plastic buttons have a bit of play and aren't very secure so they move with the jolts of running, producing an annoying ticking sound (which, however, to be honest with the loud and very instrumental music can't be heard). I don't know whether to recommend them.;0
1051; Excellent in many respects but lacking in sound quality;" ""I have always hated earphones because they always fall out of my ears. I want to clarify right away that they don't feel """"""""bad"""""""" but an audiophile can certainly regret his favorite headphones. the bass is rather unbalanced and can be annoying at least if you are not a disco or techno fan who simply loves to let your ears and brain shine. to obtain a greater balance you need to act on the equalizer of your device or software listening. the high tones are quite clear but not """"""""crystalline"""""""" and they mix with the mid tones. so it can be said that these earphones do not really send a """"""""high quality"""""""" sound or """"""""hi-fi"""""""" as they commonly say. However, it is also true that listening is not entirely unsatisfactory. By adjusting the equalizer of your device you obtain an acceptable and overall pleasant sound for most part of the users but if you are looking for purity of sound I would say that this product is not for you. you have to consider it a compromise.conclusions:the headband made of soft and non-rigid rubber makes these headphones comfortable enough to wear even with glasses. therefore if we look at the various characteristics: comfort of use construction listening I would say that it is an excellent purchase and a good compromise on the quality/price ratio even if in my opinion something more could have been done in terms of audio quality. In any case, I wouldn't define them as a disappointing purchase, bearing in mind the cost estimate and the use we have to make of them.""""""";0
1052;They don't work; hi, the aforementioned headphones don't work or I've already returned them once and you promptly returned my money. This time the product, although it doesn't work, won't be returned as I personally destroyed it as it's worth nothing. keep my money I will delete my account unfortunately my review is terrible you sold me a product twice I don't work if this is the quality you can offer...I wish you a good future regards;0
1053;Deceived by the positive reviews;already two to nine years ago I had tried to buy bt5 earphones but I had given up as many reviews had common denominators...they had all been released on the same day by users who only had their first names. coincidences? at the time I fell back on bt4 for a few euros which sounded divine and at high volume. It's a shame that the interlocutor heard an echo during the phone calls. if used for listening only they were the maximum quality/price ratio. this time I wanted to take a risk even if it is almost impossible to have so many positive reviews for this and other models in the same range and in fact... speaking of listening to music: bass that not his or bad but medium and high ones get lost along the way. everything a bit muddy and not clear when talking about phone calls: listening at the limits of comprehensibility. pairing problems with devices;0
1054; Sound quality not returned. Problems with the right earphone after a month;" ""Final update: fortunately the headphones were returned to me also with insurance (which was not used as they were not purchased from Amazon but from an external seller """" oh well at least he didn't refund me we're good) after a month of not even too intensive use they broke. poor quality I confirm what was reported in the other reviews I'll leave the original review below but add this update: after a month the right earphone it no longer responds to the charging base it doesn't even show the charging indicator so I don't know if it's charging. I've been using it for a week now in the hope that it will charge without saying so but I expect it could turn off at any moment. for luckily I got it with insurance so we'll see if it works too. for now as long as it recharges I use it like that but it's malfunctioning even if it continues to work. original review: I've already said everything in the title. to go into detail: it must be said that I am not an audiophile and I'm not good at messing around with equalizers and various bullshit I don't understand anything at all, I plug in the headphones and listen as it comes out. having said this, the audio quality is significantly lower than other headphones I have (I have a pair from Sony that I paid 40 euros for a few months ago and it sounds perfect) the bass is strong (update: I read in other reviews that these poor brands pump the bass to mask the poor audio quality (other) but in fact they are so strong that they cover the rest of the sound range. beyond everything I am aware that you cannot have everything and I opted for this product not for the audio quality but because it is declared waterproof. I even take a shower with these on and so far I'm working or still (for a month) that's enough for me. for the record I also bought the insurance because I can trust the waterproof cover to hold up, at least I feel more at ease: it's very good that this option exists and we hope that the insurance also works well, which in any case I hope I won't have to use.""";0
1055; cables not soldered; unfortunately, when we opened the package to try them on at the ninth birthday party, we realized that the connection cables in one earphone had not been soldered. Furthermore, we found the package left leaning outside the door with the falsified delivery signature ;0
1056; the sound is good but they fall out of the ears too often; there was a time when the earphones had an elastic headband around the neck they seemed to be the top of the technology they were very comfortable they didn't interfere with the glasses and you couldn't move them even by struggling Greek Roman. and instead, in order to pursue the novelty, a sensational step was taken backwards by inventing separate earphones with rubber hooks. and there is no way to find different ones except those without even the hook which for people like me fall before even putting them on. Manufacturers need to get it into their heads that not all ears will hold earphones simply by placing them in the hollow of the ear! for many you need a spring or a system to hold them up. apart from this they feel good in particular the bass is strong (perhaps too much). the button to go forward and backward in the song is missing, the rubber caps sometimes come off by pulling them out of the pocket but above all I find them on the floor with any gesture to fix my hair or to remove the mask or glasses. impossible to carry them on my bike, I use the old ones while they last. Unfortunately, modernity leads us to always consume new objects, whatever this is. This is a sad example. But be careful, perhaps I found on a German site some earphones with a headband very similar to a pair of mine which are they were broken: they were wonderful, very light, very small, I forgot them on me, they had a little voice and 5 on/off control buttons, vol. + and - track + and - or forward + and -. a whole other world... now outdated (sigh!);0
1057;It's a shame that they stopped working; they would be my perfect headphones, they fit beautifully in the ear, good audio, comfortable, easy and with functional buttons. I'm very sorry because after 3 times that I used them while running (always used correctly) the right earphone stopped working because it could no longer charge in its charger. however the left one has always worked. I tried to do various resets but I wasn't able to make them work correctly and so I had to return them and I got another brand that was a little less nice than that. I saw that some reviews here reveal the same problem so I didn't have the courage to reorder them. if the manufacturer would have improved the product they would be the perfect headphones.;0
1058;I don't return out of pure laziness but:;the 5/4 star reviews of these earphones are clearly fake or for refund professionals. they are earphones that can be found in any Chinese shop for no more than 10. the quality of the plastic is embarrassing! the box breaks just by looking at it and the construction flaws are everywhere! terrible audio and microphone no less. Shame on those who never talked about deep bass and well-balanced mid-high frequencies! the earphones with jack supplied with smartphones are definitely better. paring outlawed: they pair independently with the smartphones of nearby apartment buildings and in traffic it is not uncommon to hear the conversations of strangers. I won't comment on the life of the batteries because we know: generally this type of product breaks even before the batteries die. in conclusion, I recommend looking elsewhere for those looking for products with good value for money and be wary of overly enthusiastic reviews.;0
1059;Not satisfactory;unfortunately it was not possible to evaluate the quality of the product as it worked alternately one earphone at a time and then stopped definitively after a few days. contacted the seller who was very helpful and correct in collecting the product for free and returning the amount spent.;0
1060; Problems after a short while; after a couple of months of use with both telephone and TV with excellent results, the headphones became disconnected and it is no longer possible to make them work as before. they are known as two separate earphones and function as one at a time, either the d for or the s for. Unfortunately I have tried everything but there is no way to restore them. the manual does not contain reset procedures or anything else. I'll try calling support and see if it fixes it.;0
1061;Potentially excellent but...;... I never managed to recharge the battery;0
1062; Good headphones with good durability; the purchased product is quite valid with a good and quite precise sound. The battery life is excellent and with its charging base it is possible to recharge the headphones (almost completely discharged) for at least 5-6 times therefore very convenient. unfortunately I had two problems pairing the headphones together (I could only hear one or the other headphones and not in stereo mode, both connected to a phone). after carefully following the instructions I none worked. unfortunately when it happened the second time (about 4 months after purchase) I no longer had the instructions and so I had to try and waste a lot of time to restore the possibility of listening to the headphones together. unfortunately I tried to ask the retailer for a copy of the manual (via email received from Amazon support) without ever receiving a response. Too bad.;0
1063; not suitable for listening during a run; everything works correctly but as soon as I put it on during a run I started to feel a tic every time I put my foot down. analyzing better I noticed that when shaking the earphone you can feel that the inside is not well fixed and therefore it shakes inside the casing. this is evident during running therefore listening is ruined with a continuous tic. I return them because they are not suitable for running.;0
1064;Product above expectations. Battery less!; considering the price the product greatly exceeded expectations. in detail: good noise reduction just by wearing them you are isolated from external noises the sound is very good... it crackles a little only in the case of songs with more accentuated bass very comfortable... personally they start to bother me after 1 hour of use (but bearable, I'm particularly sensitive, perhaps because of my small ears). The case is very practical in plastic but you can see that the material isn't that great... in the sense of fragility. They're easy to use in terms of touch controls. Unique flaw: the battery. I probably made a mistake by not turning them off every time I put them back in the case but in general they don't last very long. with one charge I used it for 3/4 days for a use of approximately 1 hour per day. However, overall I highly recommend them given the price if the only use you make of them is sporadic but you want the convenience of Bluetooth headphones it is an excellent choice!!! ;0
1065; Good for hand-free communication; I was interested in earphones that would allow me to talk hands-free and after several purchases I finally found what I was looking for with this product. The interlocutor hears as well as if I were speaking into the microphone of the mobile phone and that is which interested me the most. They connect quickly after removing them from the charging case and can be used independently. The audio is good, perhaps not the best but for talking they are ok. The battery life is satisfactory. They are a little bigger than many other earphones I have had but they remain firmly attached to the ear. I am satisfied with the purchase and I recommend them to anyone who wants earphones for hands-free communication.;0
1066; Excellent value for money; the product arrived on time and works very well for what I use it for calls or hearing the news. I don't need perfection on a musical level. I don't understand why I wasn't given the discount code indicated even if I didn't get it with the offers. However the prices are affordable for what you need. the defects I find are: I don't get the message notification sound even if I have set them when a call arrives it reads the number in English and not just the ringtone.;0
1067;Review update after 2 months of purchase;"review after two months unfortunately I had to return the product. after the first month I had the first difficulties the earphones remained connected to the phone even when put away. the battery charge light started flashing fixed at ""88"" without moving from this number anymore and then it didn't turn on at all. One week one of the two earphones no longer turned on. Unfortunately I had to return the product... purchase review, comfortable to read and good audio. The microphone on the other hand is not optimal. Those who receive my calls tell me that they hear a little disturbed and with a very low volume. I bought them mainly for sports and from this point of view I am very happy with them and would recommend them to those who don't want to spend excessively. for those who want to make a purchase more for the appearance, phone calls, based on my experience, I would suggest another item. I believe that for my use it has an optimal quality/price ratio.";0
1068;Item can be improved;the item is not bad. the audio is good and what is not at all obvious when speaking on the other end the audio is acceptable. the biggest flaw of this article is the taking of the headphones from the case and the strange rotation that must be done to bring them to the ear in the correct position and vice versa. the movements to be made are not intuitive and in the end you have to use both hands to position them correctly in the ear. even opening the charging case is not easy.;0
1069;they fall;very cute. neat packaging... nothing to say. However, I had to return them as they are not suitable for me. I use them for my brisk walking and unfortunately they don't stay attached to the ear but they continually fall off. I don't know if it's due to the shape of my ears...but in any case now I've purchased a different type;0
1070; Absolutely not adequate; unfortunately my review is negative. I don't know if I was unlucky but I highly doubt it. Very pleasant and fixed in the ears, they were immediately associated with both the iPhone and the Apple Watch but unfortunately on both at the first song with important bass (blinding lights by the weeknd) these Bluetooth earphones have not proven its limits with hissing noises and annoying sticks when playing the song at medium volume. Even externally pleasant but too plasticky overall giving that immediate perception of cheapness. shame. excellent prime shipping;0
1071; Not even 3 months old; the headphones left me after 3 months of life even if the problems started already after two months when Bluetooth pairing had become a real nuisance between the slow pairing and the automatic pairing of the headphones upon removing the case which worked every other time, to the point of convincing me to re-associate them manually with each use. as I was saying, death came after three months but the signs were already visible after the first month when I saw that in the left slot of the case the headphones were not always seen as inserted and therefore charging. today after not too frequent use as the headphones were only used in the gym I noticed that both the metal resistance present on the headphones for charging as well as the pin present in the case for transferring energy were completely corroded as if they had reacted when they came into contact (also making me question the safety of the product given that I don't think it's normal to have such reactions in a battery case kept in a coat pocket). apart from all this I won't focus on the audio quality of the headphones in the period in which they worked since it is a quality in line with the low cost of the headphones. low cost which however cannot justify its death so quickly and all the Bluetooth pairing problems encountered during its use. there are headphones in the same price range and I have had ones that can go on without giving any problems. The many positive reviews leave me perplexed: either they were made after a week of purchase (when in fact it didn't give me any problems either) or I don't know since I doubt I'm the only person who got the product leaving the factory with both hardware and software problems.;0
1072; The box hisses and they connect even when the box is closed; I'll update the review after a couple of weeks of use. when I put the earphones back in the box they hiss very clearly to the level that it becomes annoying if you keep it on the desk while working . Is mine faulty or are they all like this? The earphones sometimes fail even when the box is closed and there is no way to disconnect them except by turning off the phone's Bluetooth. The audio I listen to is very good during calls, they tell me hear some background noise and annoying rustling. In conclusion I have to ask for a return.;0
1073;I've tried better;a truly standard product. nothing but super sound as described in the adverts. the product is really nothing special yes I agree the audio for listening to music is really average without super bass crystal clear audio etc etc. as far as calls are concerned, that's the sore point. users on the other hand hear really unclear and low even though I had set the volumes to maximum. if you can buy something else because I do not recommend this product if you have high-end needs and expectations from these earphones.;0
1074;0;after a lot of good will in seeking quality in the apparatus I must say that there was great disappointment: enhanced bass?;0
1075;You can hear the speaker but they can't hear you on the other end;the product was below all expectations... really bad. excellent packaging very nice but on the other side they don't hear you. I've done several factory resets, I've tried changing the phone to connect them to... but nothing. really disappointed. they were probably defective because most of the reviews are very good and convinced me to order them.;0
1076;Bluetooth Headphones 5.1 Enhanced Bass Wireless Sports Earphones IP7 Waterproof; I purchased this type of headphones twice as I considered them adequate for the use I made of them;0
1077; Good at first... then thrown away!; bought on offer for 27 euros... good in terms of sound and battery life... shame that the first headphones only charged for 2 months and the second stopped after that 5... you put them in the accommodation but there is some problem with the contacts... morale... throw them away!;0
1078; They do their job; headphones without pretentions to be the same as other much more expensive ones. None, they have a good sound with adequate bass. The battery life is also not bad. I used them for more than 4 hours and they were still not empty, very comfortable to use. only flaw during calls if there is a bit of noise the interlocutor can't hear well you have to raise your voice a little however I recommend them.;0
1079; Excellent; honestly, I always look for products where the quality-price ratio prevails even though I already have other Bluetooth earphones that fit me very well. They have the problem that they don't have supports to hook behind the ears and therefore they often fell and risked losing them. .for the sporting activities that I carry out I needed a model with hooks. I consider myself lucky in my choice because it did not meet my expectations both in terms of stability and good loud and clear audio and for me, who have a little hearing loss, they turned out to be an excellent choice. also because the price (black friday) was attractive. an excellent purchase.;0
1080;Disappointed;after 3 months of use you can practically hear nothing from the right headphone and the left one is starting to have connection problems. I bought another one a year ago which had worked very well, unfortunately one of the headphones ended up under the wheel of a car. I was hoping to find the same quality but the duration of the case, charging is much shorter and the headphones are less long lasting.;0
1081;Defective charging base;"I have already bought two pairs. I thought the first ones were defective because I had bought them from the warehouse. I tried to buy them new but nothing. Same problem: the charging base is defective. One of the ""teeth"" that it should recharge the headphones after a few days it fits inside the case and it no longer works. second return this time I'll change the item!";0
1082;Good but not very good;I purchased them with the interest of having a truly ergonomic product in my hands and suitable for sports. Unfortunately I had a bad experience: the stick to put behind the ear tends to make the ears protrude. I returned them. Personally I didn't have a good experience for this reason. However, I think the audio quality and the value for money are excellent.;0
1083; Very well made, excellent value for money; the package is in a nice shape and comes with everything: a very nice case, a charging cable (USB type C), spare earphone covers with two different sizes. the audio quality is very good, the bass feels right (not too accentuated). on the battery life, having arrived a few days ago, I still have to do some tests so I will update the reviews. They arrived already loaded. For now I can only be satisfied and I recommend the product.;0
1084; Bluetooth headphones; the headphones are good in terms of sound and practicality but unfortunately after the first day of use they no longer recharged. I tried several times with the charging base which indicated 3 out of 4 LEDs at the start of charging. Shortly afterwards it seemed fully charged but the headphones did not charge. I did the return. Amazon always impeccable both in terms of deliveries and customer service. thanks;0
1085; Short duration; the headphones did not satisfy me upon their arrival. comfortable, good quality even if the bass is still suitable for low coast headphones. in short, I wore them a lot, especially for physical activity. After two months, however, the right earphone turns on but turns off after a few seconds (the two earphones can be turned on individually). Too bad;0
1086; After less than a month of use the two earphones dissociate from each other and no longer pair; I bought the earphones as a welcome gift, initially they worked and were fine but after less than a month they dissociated and despite countless attempts there was no way to associate them with each other, they no longer associated with each other. I followed the instructions provided to me by telephone by Amazon assistance (I highly recommend Amazon assistance, the operators are trained, kind and patient) or followed the instructions provided to me by the seller who, among other things, after an initial email with these instructions, was not done more alive it disappeared so I had to contact Amazon support again who helped me greatly in returning the earphones.;0
1087;Maluccio;overrated product is not bad but we are mediocre. low volume, unbalanced sound between highs and lows, the earphones turn on again once they are charged, without connecting to the phone again and prematurely discharging the battery. Did you not buy their reviews too? I was better off with the 3 to 9 old Mpows!;0
1088; Big disappointment; it is a product of very poor quality: - sound quality: low - battery life: unsatisfactory, less than 60 minutes of music listening - noise reduction: undetectable - the multifunction keys are very insensitive and ineffective (the one on the right headphone remained blocked) - the pairing function works in fits and starts according to a mysterious logic. I am therefore very disappointed both with the quality of the product and with Amazon which evidently lends itself to marketing products of such poor quality...despite the price is not very low.;0
1089;After less than a month of use the right earphone no longer works;"I waited to write a review to see how it compared. At first I was quite happy with the ""fit"" and the audio was good. case could have been improved. However, after less than a month of use mainly for listening to music, the right earphone runs out of battery immediately. I don't understand if the earphone is faulty or if it's the container that doesn't make contact and doesn't charge the earphone. of the tests with the tester. In conclusion I advise against it.";0
1090; low quality and low sound; with low quality headphones you can't hear much and the battery lasts very little. Furthermore, many times you can't pair it with new devices or you have to do it many times until it works. I have to turn the volume to maximum to hear the sounds well . calls I make nice design but the performance is very low.;0
1091;Earphones good for listening to music, not for calls;the earphones are decent for listening to music but unfortunately I find them completely useless for phone calls as often the person I'm talking to struggles to hear me and says that my voice can be heard very far away. outdoors then we don't really talk about it with all the street noise. I'll return it.;0
1092; Two returns out of two; the sound is good and the fit too. it's a shame that after about ten uses the d per headset no longer charges and becomes unusable. item returned and repurchased. the second lasted about ten days after which the headset continues to disconnect from Bluetooth. really unreliable.;0
1093;I thought they were excellent but after 3 months they no longer work!;I had already done a review where I gave 5 stars but I have to do another one where I give only one! after 3 months I don't work or more even though they are charged they turn on and after a few seconds they turn off for no reason one doesn't even turn on anymore used 2/3 times a week to go running and that's it;0
1094;Exaggerated bass. Excellent battery life. I was looking for a pair of Bluetooth headphones so that they wouldn't abandon me during the 8 hours of work and this product fully satisfies my needs. Sound quality not at the top but acceptable. In my opinion the bass is a little too accentuated. overall an excellent product.;I was looking for a pair of Bluetooth headphones so that they wouldn't abandon me during the 8 hours of work and this product fully meets my needs. Sound quality not at the top but acceptable. In my opinion the bass is a little too accentuated. Overall an excellent product .;0
1095;Unfortunately disappointed;I tried these headphones doing some ru nonong sessions. they adhere well, excellent sound but after two times I had problems recharging the left part which no longer turned on. they adhere well to the ear even if you feel some movement with sweat. unfortunately I had to return them because they don't work;0
1096; Returned as not working; unfortunately I have to change my review after only 10 days, one of the two earphones stopped connecting, entering a continuous paring mode loop without being able to stop. After I tried to reconfigure it for a spin, it stopped to recharge it. I had to return it, sorry.;0
1097;Too powerful bass;really powerful bass. I don't like them too loud but the headphones are really excellent! As soon as I put them on they seemed cheap then I realized that I had to rotate them back on the ear and that's when the super bass arrived. in any case I recommend the purchase.;0
1098; Convenient to carry it when you run.; perfect when you go out for a run they stick very well to the ears the only negative point is that every now and then when you put it on charge you can only charge it 1 and not both of them you have to move it yourself so it works ninth contact this happens to me after the 2nd week of use perhaps. I'm the one who has this bad luck.;0
1099;WIRELESS HEADPHONES;purchased these headphones to avoid having to worry about the wire and I can say that they are comfortable, practical and stable......I'm removing a star only because in telephone conversations you can't hear well while music and other things are hears well and with a little pronounced bass.;0
1100; Excellent sound but uncomfortable; excellent sound and good sound insulation. The case is nice even if it's a little bulky. the biggest flaw is that the earphones are not adjustable! neither in height nor in length and you can't even orient yourself. after a while it doesn't hurt. another flaw is the play/stop button positioned exactly on the point of the earphone which must be inserted into the ear and since it is not touch it must be pressed forcefully causing one to get hurt;0
1101;Very disappointed;I purchased the previous model, I was enthusiastic about it and therefore I had no doubts about which model of Bluetooth headphones to get now. they are absolutely the best on the market edit dated 10/11/2021 to date the headphones no longer charge for no reason. I sweat a lot and the contacts have oxidized. A month ago my right earphone stopped working and the other day the left one.. very disappointed;0
1102;Forget it;"Product not recommended. The sound as long as it works or is excellent. The problem is that it didn't work for a couple of days. Then the problems started first with the left earphone and then the right. The left one as soon as it was put on the ear told me  ""power off"""" and it turns off so evidently it didn't take the charge even if it remained in the charging cover for days and days and then even the right one. finally they died completely they don't turn on when removing them from the charging cover and therefore they can't be used because they don't turn on they pair it doesn't work, not even when charging while I'm at home to do so. Highly recommended product. Delivery times were respected""";0
1103;Reconsideration on Bluetooth Headphones 5.1 Enhanced Bass IP7 Wireless Sports Earphones;Hello.Initially they went very well. Yes, they don't sound very quickly, etc. Now, however, after about 4 months of use, the sound emitted by the headphones has become much lower and you can no longer hear well even when the volume is turned up to maximum. As an assessment, I would say that they are very poor. do not buy.;0
1104;bought the item 2 times but with the same defect;I bought the product twice. the first time after about two months the right earphone stopped charging but we thought it was due to failure as it was very wet after the run. we tried again with a second purchase being careful and despite everything after more than a month the right earphone stopped charging again. reading the reviews no one mentions this defect. I'll try to ask for a refund at least for the second purchase.;0
1105; Not suitable for running; pros: + adequate sound for earphones in this price range. + adequate battery life cons: - extremely cheap materials - disc no continuous Bluetooth connections related to sweat - ergonomics lets a lot of air enter between the earphone and the ear which is disturbing a lot of sound. better to choose earphones with the body that enters the auricle. I used the product for about 20 days before the review, therefore using it in about 12 outings.;0
1106; Bluetooth headphones; looking for an ergonomic product I came across these headphones with almost valid reviews. I therefore confirm the ergonomics, you cannot feel the (minimum) weight of the headphones on the earcup after a few hours but at most after 4/5 ( some pain but it can be subjective) the acoustics however are not exactly the best because: the low frequencies are too present and the high frequencies are almost non-existent. They need to improve on this. However, after already two weeks of using them, the battery isn't bad at all and the connection is almost lightning fast. not a lick of noise comes in from the outside... top! I would lower the price just for the audio quality;0
1107; Poor quality; the idea of the case that acts as a mini powerbank is nice. Everything else is negative. The headphones fit but are uncomfortable. during the run, at each step you hear a pop on the right headphones. several times it happened to me during a long run that the right audio was interrupted for several minutes and then resumed for a few minutes and so on. often during the run the connection It has holes lasting a second. The icing on the cake is that after 2 months I can no longer charge one of the earphones. Ah, I forgot the noise canceling is completely non-existent;0
1108; Poor quality headphones with exaggerated bass; if you don't want to hear the voice but only the base of a track these are the right earphones for you! extremely powerful, almost annoying bass that does not guarantee a clean sound like other earphones in the same price range.;0
1109; Useful for playing sports but that's it; I tried the different sizes of data caps supplied but unless you squeeze the headphones inside your ears by hand the bass is non-existent and the overall volume is very low. try different applications from spotify to youtube. the only positive note is that they are comfortable but terrible audio quality.;0
1110; very very high quality/price ratio; I thought it was an excellent product: very good, full and enveloping sound quality, especially when wearing both earphones. It fits well in the ear and stays in place easily if inserted well. The battery life seemed satisfactory to me, unfortunately, however, in my case this was only half true since one of the two earphones showed very rapid battery failure, forcing me to return it. If it had been possible I would have also accepted the replacement of the defective element. I rule out buying it again because it definitely deserves another chance.;0
1111; defective product; poor sound quality, contrary to what others have reviewed, low volume and cannot be changed with the buttons which, if pressed, interfere with the new LG TV by continuously changing the channels. difficulty charging the right earphone. returned item.;0
1112; I don't know; they are light and the sound is good... as far as I know, only that at the first use the sound skipped a lot, I recharged them and now I'm trying them, the sound no longer skips, I don't know if it was because they were flat.. ..now I'm under observation;0
1113; defective products; product not suitable for racing. It's the second one I've purchased (promptly returned) and both have not exceeded their useful life of one month. the first signs are earphones that stop on their own and turn off. the product continues to work babbling for some time until it starts to take on a life of its own by raising or lowering the volume, changing songs or turning itself off. at that point they become permanently unusable. for the rest I appreciated the sound, the ergonomics in the ear and the control functions in relation to the price.;0
1114; Good product for what it costs but I expected more; for such a low price it is certainly a bargain even if honestly I was a little disappointed by the sound quality: I expected much better. if I try to listen to music at maximum volume or at a very high volume it sounds quite bad to the point of even causing annoyance. the bass is not at all clear and clean... not even the highs. Reading the various reviews I was happy to know that it sounded very good as for me this is the most important element in earphones! but instead I had to change my mind... the sound is not at all as I had imagined it, otherwise nothing to say, comfortable and long-lasting battery even if aesthetically it is clear that they are very plasticky. all in all it is a good product for what it is It's expensive although there is certainly much better so nothing exceptional.;0
1115;Good but disposable.....;I found them comfortable even while running, the sound quality is excellent. I chose them for the physical buttons. I bought them twice after returning the first pair because after two uses it no longer charged the right earphone. the second pair also had the same defect after the first use. in both cases I found a small yellow powder near the contacts of the earphone which was not charging. the assistance was very superficial and was unable to resolve the problem. two returns in less than a week.;0
1116; Good sound but it's hard to keep the Bluetooth connected; I use these headphones on a bicycle and like many others when I turn my head to the right or left the song stops I should keep the phone on the front but cycling jackets don't have pockets on the back I can't understand;0
1117; Annoying and crackling background noise; I bought other headphones like this but they had no defects... it's a shame because this time the right headphones have a background noise... it crackles continuously while the one on the left doesn't seem to have any problems. now I also have to find the time to return them....another non-negligible flaw, the seller doesn't even contact you to check if there is a simple solution to eliminate the defect;0
1118;Disappointment;I purchased these headphones a few months ago and within a few months they started having problems with charging. one headset charges and the other doesn't or neither of the two, in short, a constant annoyance that often prevents me from using them. It's a shame this vicious circle started after 30 days to be able to return it, otherwise I would have sent it back to the sender immediately. Terrible.;0
1119;BLUETOOTH 5.1 HEADPHONES;"unfortunately I haven't been able to use them for long as the battery doesn't perform. After about 1/2 hour of use the message ""no battery arrives"". I tried to reset them as recommended by assistance but it wasn't worth it and this was after keeping them charged all night. I asked to return the product.""";0
1120;They are worth what you spend.;They cost little and are worth little. the sound is flat with cut bass and a prevalence of medium notes. I use them for TV and even for this use they are not exceptional. for the rest they are ok, comfortable and light, they immediately connect to Bluetooth and don't lose it.;0
1121;Headphones that are worth what you pay.;arrived on time, the headphones have good sound quality, are practical and have a long-lasting battery. the noise cancellation is not that evident, I would say that it only attenuates it. It seems like a good purchase, we'll see over time;0
1122;They don't move you won't lose them;for the moment I've only been using them for a few days the sound when using it while riding the scooter is good and never excessive the charging box is perhaps a little big for the pocket so who thinks of always carrying it with them without bag will do well to evaluate this feature which on the other hand obviously grants more autonomy;0
1123;Discrete product. I don't recommend it.;I expected much more from this product. The sound is not exciting. The stops above the ears are not adjustable and therefore it doesn't work. But the saddest thing is the reception. Just go to the room next door. and you lose the signal too bad.;0
1124;Practical;the headphones are comfortable to wear, light and easy to use.unfortunately after using them 3 times the fourth time the right headphones don't work i.e. you can't hear anything while the left one works fine I tried to recharge but the headphones didn't work worked. will not be returned. thanks;0
1125; Bluetooth 5.1 headphones Enhanced Bass IP7 Wireless Sports Earphones... never again; problems from the start! tried all the possible resets which worked randomly and the headset stopped charging almost immediately.. . and in any case for the little that didn't work they produced a simply terrible sound.. unfortunately I let the time required for the return pass and coincidentally for this object no type of assistance is provided after the return......!! definitively thrown away like the money I spent...very bad;0
1126; Bluetooth headphones; I returned the product and I disagree with the excellent reviews these earphones enjoy because there was a drop in performance after about 10-15 uses and I found them uncomfortable to wear. the system with which they adapt to the ears after a while it became painful;0
1127;Waiting for assistance;I'm sorry I couldn't leave a review because as soon as you purchased the power bank (the headphone container) it didn't charge, it's probably faulty for the amount of charge I was able to use it seems like a good product, now I've done it a return procedure I hope to correctly carry out the procedures to run with the headphones very comfortable and intuitive for operation thanks for the assistance;0
1128;Lightweight, pleasantly easy.;They connect easily and quickly, they work well, they don't bother your ears and they have a good operating life and a short charging time. I feel very comfortable and am satisfied.;0
1129;Disappointing! Already broken!; disappointing!!! delivered on August 13th and used only 5 times for an average of one hour of running for a total activity of 6 hours. after less than a month the right earphone stopped working and charging. it only turns on the light is red but it shows no signs of life and it won't charge. I will ask for a return because as far as I can see from the reviews the defect is in the product itself.;0
1130;Don't buy them;after just a month the right headphone wasn't charging. the very kind seller sent me another pair with an 80% discount. after a few days the right earphone turns off on its own for no reason. choose another product;0
1131; I do not recommend purchasing them; ok they are low cost but: - when you take them out of the case only one in two headphones turns on - you have to turn them off manually when you finish using them putting them in the case is not enough (unlike other models) - quality listening ok but poor quality of the microphone: if you use it to make calls on the other side it will curse you I won't return it;0
1132;Good but....;good product, excellent sound and good battery life. Unfortunately, however, after a few recharges I had connection problems for charging due to contacts and other problems with the case.;0
1133;Good purchase suggested by my son;I have an iPhone and when I bought the headphones I thought that they wouldn't work like all the other non-original ones I had purchased so far. and instead I work not only to listen to music but also to make phone calls! now we need to understand how long they last, that is, whether they resist or break. exactly nine months after purchase, unfortunately one of the two earphones can no longer be heard. I think it's a charger problem. shame because they felt good;0
1134;Stable on the ear for the bike;excellent headphones for quality/price ratio. comfortable to wear and remain stable for the bicycle, they are excellent lightweight even if a little bulky in size. they also perform well for phone calls, no one has complained of distortions or disturbances when I speak. you can even make a phone call in the street but the interlocutors can hear the surrounding noise.;0
1135; Disappointment; excellent purchase from the start, a surprise... crisp and clean sound... but... after 4 months the left earphone stopped charging and was therefore unusable.... in the 10th month the right earphone also stopped charging... ceased to exist...duration too limited to be able to express a positive opinion;0
1136;Total bin;"despite having been charging for hours. the autonomy was 2 minutes. I thought it was a pairing problem but when I turned them back on I heard ""power on"" followed by an immediate ""power off"". very bad to say the least";0
1137; to forget; after many positive comments I decide to buy them, an absolute disappointment after only 2 days of use, the left headphone runs out of charge in less than 1 minute even after several recharges, always the same problem, one headphone works, the other non-existent, I then request the collection for the refund never seen anyone I ask again never seen anyone maybe something is wrong maybe? I will try to request a 3rd collection but I find it tough maybe there is an obscure problem that disorientates the couriers?????;0
1138; Broken after 4 months; the product is of poor quality. during the rebound stroke you hear a metallic noise as if there was a part inside that is not well fixed. after 4 months of use 1-2 times a week (only for training) the headphones no longer charge despite having tried to clean both the headphones and the case to charge them;0
1139;Disposable product;I am reviewing this product 3 months after purchase.As regards the sound quality I would say medium/low;0
1140; they seemed excellent...; they seemed excellent but after two months the headset stopped working (it no longer charged). seeing as it's a common problem. focus on greater quality. I asked for a return under warranty and the excellent Amazon service did it.;0
1141;Bluetooth 5.1 headphones;the earphones feel good they never move or fall out however the right earphone has a noise like an internal ticking when running as if something is banging and it is quite annoying. the battery of each individual earphone lasts for over 6 hours before needing to be recharged.;0
1142;Always broken.;The product is not bad but after 2 weeks it doesn't work well. I returned the product and a different problem arose on the new product. I definitely don't recommend it, I won't try it the third time;0
1143; Excellent headset, mediocre microphone; the audio is very good as is the noise isolation, unfortunately during a telephone call the interlocutor has low volume problems. as happens with this type of earphones, the microphones are always not very sensitive... never mind...;0
1144;Bad purchase; I must note that, contrary to what I have read in the reviews, my voice seems distant and disturbed to my interlocutors, making conversation difficult. Furthermore, three days after purchase it was no longer possible to connect the earphones to the Samsung A32 phone. I tried pairing the devices again but to no avail. in short, a useless purchase and a terrible product.;0
1145;Basic;practices. comfortable and practical. the structure has a certain thickness so even if I dropped it a couple of times their sturdiness is spectacular. the nice thing is that since they are not special, no one steals them from you but they are fantastic.;0
1146;Not working.;I couldn't even try. the headphones do not turn on. I tried every way and with every charger/charging mode. terrible purchase I immediately started the return process.;0
1147; poor waterproofness; watch out for ru noners. waterproofing leaves a lot to be desired. after only two exits the right earphone remained covered in sweat. Oxidized charging contacts. the right earphone no longer charges. It's a shame because the audio is good and the headphones are very comfortable while running;0
1148;Bad audio;"I don't understand the positive reviews, the bass is non-existent and the audio quality is ""dirty"" they don't cancel out external noises at all making listening to music even worse than it is";0
1149;I wouldn't buy them again;I use these headphones mainly for running. I use them every day for at least an hour of training. for the cost nothing to say about drum sound or performance issues. after less than two months the right earphone no longer charges and pairing/unpairing with the phone has become complicated. I wouldn't buy them again.;0
1150;I DO NOT FIND THEM PRACTICAL;they are small and practical to carry....also because they have no wires that impede movement...but I have difficulty using them...I find them ingenious! I can't reconcile listening...phone calls...messages! everything gets tangled!!! I'll try to practice a little more!!;0
1151; Good but cumbersome to use; in the end the product is not bad, the only flaw is that in synchronizing the two earphones so that you can hear from both, otherwise one excludes the other, the synchronization system is cumbersome and the institutions do not help, they are very unclear so it's a trial and error process, some might even think they are defective.;0
1152;Disappointed;let me start by saying that I am reviewing 5 minutes after wearing the earphones for the first time.but they are terrible.I bought them as a replacement for mpow but they are not at the same height...update of November 11th: the right earphone is not it works anymore.;0
1153;Unpretentious; I think they are excellent for listening to music, a little less so for calls because the interlocutor complains of not hearing my voice well. I'm not very technological and I'm not very good at remembering the various commands.....;0
1154; Very disappointing sound quality; I bought the headphones because I had seen the high reviews regarding the sound quality and unfortunately I was disappointed... the sound quality is very modest, nothing much because I was thinking of replacing my old headphones but the sound quality is not comparable. I use them for sport and it is essential to listen to high quality music to increase motivation. will be set aside;0
1155; Good product, attention to wearability; good quality/price ratio, immediate configuration, good sound, quite comfortable in daily use. Unfortunately, I took them to go running and I can't wear them satisfactorily. I will initiate the return.;0
1156;Beautiful but not long-lasting;used with enthusiasm for 3 weeks, one channel failed: it no longer recharged in its designated seat. Once the return procedure was started, there was no home collection as agreed by the Amazon operator. result: no news and no email from the Amazon system. I was convinced they were serious...;0
1157;Disappointment;package not arrived and lost....Amazon refunded promptly but I was expecting a small compensation by way of apology having been without a mobile phone for a month after having returned the previous one due to a defect in the accelerometer.Both mobile phone and earphones lost .total disappointment;0
1158;They can't hear you!;objectively it is a device with good sound quality. shame from the point of view of the sensitivity of the microphones: I couldn't make myself heard. completely unusable for the use I made of them: returned.;0
1159; quite good; the product works well and feels quite good, they are comfortable and thanks to the arches they don't fall out, the battery lasts a long time to the point that they have never run down to zero. Of course there is better on the market in terms of battery life. build quality etc. (a little cheap plastic) but I repeat, it works well and therefore I recommend the purchase.;0
1160; It no longer charges; terrible product quality. After the fifth charge, the left earphone no longer charges even though I have always dried it carefully at the end of each use and followed all the precautions indicated in the instruction sheet. I'm only using the right one for as long as it lasts... too bad because I felt good in my training sessions.;0
1161; THEY LASTED A DAY; I was happy to have found comfortable headphones, too bad that on the first day they didn't work well with the exception of the output volume which was low, from the second day I was no longer able to get them recharged and automatically after about 30 seconds they went off. not to repeat the experience, sorry;0
1162; Purchase not to be repeated; I relied on the excellent reviews and instead I must say that in the past for 14 euros I have purchased decidedly better headphones. high price for the quality of the headphones (very soft plastic) as they dance too much when you are moving but above all the audio is of mediocre quality. very thin and annoying rubbers.;0
1163;I had problems;it's already the second pair I've bought. The first didn't charge the left earphone after a while. I thought it was my fault because I didn't dry them well from the sweat after use so I bought another pair after a while. given the same problem despite the care in drying them after use.;0
1164;It's a shame; after they were used twice, I mean only twice, the right headphones stopped working and no longer charge. made the return immediately. It's a shame because it was quite comfortable and stable on the ear while running!!!;0
1165;They work well; the headphones I received work well, the sound quality seems good to me but I'm not an expert so my opinion is worth little. What I can say is that I really like the sound that reaches my ears. ;0
1166;From my personal opinion n;after a week of use it started to malfunction disc no continuous connections and in any case with both Android and iOS sent it back then the sound quality personally wasn't that great;0
1167;Terrible;decent sound quality for having paid 25 euros.ridiculous material quality..!as you can see from the photo, after the first fall, the charging contacts came off the right earphone (it was charged on the left).it's really true that more spend and spend less. not recommended.;0
1168; Headphones for running; for the cost, it's a good product. Too bad it didn't last long because with the sweat you produce when you run, one of the two headphones no longer charged because the contact was oxidized. It recharges you in zero time. full cost refunded;0
1169;They disconnect by themselves;sorry but is it normal for them to disconnect by themselves if you don't listen to music for two minutes and every time you have to remember not to disconnect them??? another brand I bought they always remained with them until you fucked them!;0
1170; Lasts a few hours and then....; very comfortable, excellent listening on calls and music. I used it for about 15 hours a day for three days without charging it, the battery was still at 70% while also listening to music. excellent purchase to replace my old headset.;0
1171; bought twice, same problem twice (headphone charging doesn't work) - returned both; bought in June, used 10-15 times in August, inserting the headphones into the charging base and they didn't start. once everything was ok I immediately bought another identical pair since the headphones were fine for my use anyway...I returned them today for the same problem....;0
1172;After 2 months they stopped working.;It didn't work well for 2 months then the sound volume dropped considerably and the keys to raise it no longer work;0
1173; Pleasant surprise; taken as a replacement for more bulky BT headphones and not very suitable for the summer period. Of course the sound quality is not the same (the others are Bose headphones) but these headphones feel very good and are decidedly more comfortable for summer and for running.;0
1174;Good for music.;I tried the headphones for listening to music and found them good. However, they are not suitable for calls because the incoming and outgoing audio is poor, so I returned them and received a refund easily.;0
1175; An earphone no longer works after 1 month; the sound would be fine and all in all they are also comfortable, the problem is that after 3 uses the left earphone no longer charges and the right one still has a lot of difficulty charging... wrote to them, tried to clean the contact but to no avail...called Amazon for refund;0
1176;Beautiful but they dance!;"excellent stability thanks to the ear hook, good bass but when you run one of the two headphones has a noise of something not fixed, a really annoying ""tack"" at every step. shame because even the battery and the case are excellent";0
1177; good value for money; the headphones work well, I use them with the iPhone a point not in favor is the container/battery which is a bit bulky.;0
1178; Excellent value for money; used for both long and short outings in very hot weather which involve excessive sweating and a wet hat under the fountain. after just 4 uses the headphones no longer turn on. made returned;0
1179;They seem good at the beginning but then...;I bought these headphones to follow a webinar course on zoom..at the beginning everything was fine even if every now and then they went silent or the microphone didn't work. however from one day to the next I was no longer able to use them, I even tried to reinstall them but nothing... I certainly wouldn't buy them again.;0
1180; Bluetooth headset; invalid product as after 2 months from purchase the right earphone is no longer able to charge and the volume even at maximum is not very high. the worst thing is the fact that I cannot return it as I could have done it by the 11th of June and now what should I do??;0
1181;Only the high frequencies!!!;only the crystal clear highs can be heard, yes, but in the absence of adequate bass the sound is not pleasant. good battery and very easy connection, very useful controls with finger touches. returned because I'm looking for a warmer sound.;0
1182; The right one stopped working after 2 times; product received in the right time. Good sound quality and interface with the phone. Too bad the right one stopped working after 2 times. in total he spent 2 hours in life. now it won't charge or turn on anymore.very disappointed;0
1183; Returned after a week due to malfunction; after less than 7 days one of the two earphones no longer turned on. probably the protection from sweat during sports use is not that effective. I made the return. however they were comfortable to wear and the sound quality and power were good. the microphone a little less powerful;0
1184;Bad purchase;bought twice and returned them twice.I use the headphones for running and twice the contacts on the headphones have oxidized. the battery charger in turn has faulty contacts. after only a month of use they no longer worked. terrible purchase;0
1185; Bad quality; the headphones are nice but after 5 days of use the case that charges the headphones' battery no longer works. only the right side loads, the left no longer loads. I'm really disappointed. I'm returning it.;0
1186;What a disappointment;I waited with great anticipation for this device. at the first contact I didn't have the feeling of solidity and compactness that perhaps appeared from the photos... and in fact on the first run and therefore with a minimum of sweat the headband stuck. it never turned back on. money wasted;0
1187; absolutely not recommended; after 2 months the Bluetooth between the two devices stopped working, creating discrepancies with the device itself and between the headphones themselves. The problem persists even when resetting the Bluetooth.;0
1188;X listening to music is excellent; the music sounds very good even when someone calls you can hear it well, it's a shame that the people you talk to say they hear the volume very low. the battery lasts a long time. recommended only for listening to music!!;0
1189; Short life; very comfortable and stable headphones when worn unfortunately after a couple of weeks the case stopped charging the left headphones because when put to rest they don't touch well with the charging points. I highly recommend buying something else perhaps with a different design better.;0
1190;Volume level.;Delivery was quick. the product is very nice and the audio quality is good. however the volume level is a little low and to hear better you have to put pressure on the earphones to bring them closer to your ears.;0
1191;Cannot be connected to Huawei tablets.;Connected immediately to Huawei and Oppo phones. I must say, however, that the quality of the audio in the calls was not really good. Instead of the two Huawei tablets that we have in the family, one of which I bought recently, I was unable to connect it. I tried and tried but nothing. made the return;0
1192;Wrong purchase.;almost unusable.despite a nice design and excellent wearability, the sound quality is poor. furthermore it continuously has micro interruptions with pulses of sounds at the audio return. I couldn't wait to take them off after a 20 minute meeting. unbearable!;0
1193; Good purchase for what it's worth; it works properly, it has a lot of battery and when you do sport it stays nice and solid, the audio quality is decent for what it's worth, the only flaw is that it doesn't have a microphone so when you call you use the mobile phone's microphone ;0
1194; The battery is excellent, the sound is less; the package presents well, the battery has a long life but the volume is really low if you receive a call in a fairly noisy place you are forced to disconnect them to be able to talk furthermore the bass is practically non-existent ;0
1195;Not recommended!!!;the contacts for charging the earphones oxidized after just 2 months despite cleaning them every time after use, the consequence is that they no longer take a charge.and therefore unusable..the possibility of return expired after just one month ;0
1196; Avoidable; they last a long time, they are practical and easy to use and recharge but as they are headphones for listening I expected them to perform better! For now I use them regularly but I will certainly find out more about the sound quality in the next ones!;0
1197; Very low quality; I ordered these headphones twice. The first time the volume button was loose and you could hear the ticking of the movement during the ride. The second time there was a background electronic noise even without the volume.;0
1198;Not working;unfortunately I was only able to use them for a few hours. when I loaded them the container/charger didn't work. its display always indicated 100% charge even though the headphones were practically at 0. I requested a return.;0
1199;Very bad... Acceptable sound but...;very bad... I bought them 2 times and had the same problem 2 times. the charging bases of the case end up inside after a while it no longer reads the headphones and consequently they are always on...;0
1200;They are low. Confused and closed audio.;I was forced to return them because I felt as if my sound was composed only of bass without mids and others.confusing and closed audio both for music (mp3 and spotify) and in calls.unusable.;0
1201;Good but not for running;"good product. it connects immediately but for running it is not very good. while you are running it always makes a ""clack clack"" as if something inside was not fixed. it is very disturbing. for going by bike or car it's not good.";0
1202;After six months it no longer works;used to listen to music during walks about 2 times a week for a maximum of two hours. after almost 7 months I don't work or more!! 7 months and after the use I've made of it they seem a bit short to me ..;0
1203;Good;the main reason was to find headphones that didn't fall out and to tell the truth I found them.To tell the truth the acoustic quality is also quite good, they arrived two days ago and they seem to be fine for the moment.;0
1204;Comfortable, easy to use and good battery;really satisfactory product.delivered after a day, easy to use with touch controls and decent battery life.I remind buyers to remove the film on the headphone terminals for proper charging;0
1205;Not recommended;right earphone arrived from non-signed. It has components inside that make a lot of noise when shaking it. sometimes it just turns off and has trouble reconnecting to the cell phone. the sound is low. I am not satisfied;0
1206;A disappointment. After a month they no longer charge; a month after purchase, first one headset and then the other stopped charging despite having tried several times to clean the contacts. a disappointment. Furthermore, during running and cycling the signal is often disturbed;0
1207;To be tested;I've only had them recently so I can't give a truthful opinion yet. in any case at the moment the sound seems good even if every now and then I notice that it goes away and then returns shortly after. we'll see how I feel in the long run;0
1208;Chinoiserie;it didn't work only once after which after the second charge the battery charger stopped working and after a while the left earphone started making strange squeaking noises. just wasted time.;0
1209;Right headset is not charging;the right headset immediately showed charging problems. it was partially recharged compared to the left, now after 2 months of use it no longer recharges. I probably should have returned them immediately.;0
1210;Very bad: they do not have the characteristics described.;pros:..............cons: they claim 10 hours of battery life, reaching 4;0
1211; A good product at an affordable price (as long as it worked); negative aspects: after about ten uses the right earphone stopped working and caused the base to go haywire when it was put on charge. tried resetting but nothing. returned the product and got a refund. I hope it's an accident. Positive aspects: the earphones (finally) fit very well and the management of the functions is easy. Given the malfunction after a few uses, the final evaluation cannot be positive.;0
1212; Discreet but not suitable for running; they wouldn't be bad if the volume buttons weren't fixed to the structure when you're running they move and make an annoying noise that interferes with the music. in normal activities it is not relevant but when running it is very annoying.;0
1213;Finally a pair of bluetooth headphones that meet my expectations;I was very surprised by the sound quality and the battery life is very good. pairing with the smartphone occurs quickly and easily. the Bluetooth connection is constant and has no defects and you can listen to music even from a reasonable distance at least 4/5 metres. The product is sold in a small and handy case which also works as a charging base with a USB C cable present in the package, in addition to the cable, there are also rubber tips to adapt to the ear. The socket is not present as in every product now but only the USB C cable.;0
1214;Dosage of 500 mg not true... In reality it is 200 mg per capsule;"the product advertises a dosage of 500 mg which should correspond to the ""active ingredient"" contained in the single tablet. actually trying to read and interpret the concise indications on the back of the package which should instead be clear, unambiguous and exhaustive, we note that: 1) ambiguously reports the figure of 400 mg (already 20% lower than advertised) however referring to ""composition for 2 tablets"" which it should therefore correspond to 200 mg per single tablet, contradicting and reducing to less than half the dosage of 500 mg inserted in plain sight in the package and which should qualify the product";0
1215; Misleading label; the label and declared characteristics lead one to believe that each tablet contains 500mg of spirulina. instead 500mg is the total weight of the spirulina tablet there are only 200mg the rest are excipients. I've been using it for a few days so I won't go into the merits of its effectiveness but it seems to me that the recommended dose (from 2 to 4 tablets per day equal at 400mg or 800mg) is insufficient to show appreciable effects.;0
1216; I think it works;" ""I do cycling about 3-5 workouts a week and I must say that initially I lost a few kg but above all it seems to also work on an energy level given that as I understand it has various vitamins. for the moment I have finished the jar and being 163 cm tall and weighing 59 kg I took 2 tablets in the morning and 2 tablets in the evening respectively before breakfast and before dinner. I don't give 5 stars because I'm not 100% sure whether the weight loss is just because I went from the winter with more appetite to the summer when I eat less but in my opinion there is a benefit in both cases (weight loss and energy). However it is clear that if I did nothing I would certainly have both effects I really don't think notice or rather .... they are not """"magic pills"""" as some may think""";0
1217;Spirulina tablets;I bought this product in the hope that it would make me lose my appetite but you sent me the request to give my opinion a little too soon since it is only the third day that I have been using it. I can only say that for the moment the only difference I find is that this product makes me constipated.;0
1218; as I expected; normal spirulina algae nothing more... nothing less. taken for 3 weeks I see the normal effects of spirulina interesting price. ps: I read useless negative comments you should review the product don't give 0 stars because you haven't lost kilos etc... you haven't understood what spirulina is if you think it's a magician who can make you lose weight with just two words;0
1219;Too early;I don't know the product I've just started taking it.....I can't comment on it but I contacted the manufacturer for information and he got in touch with me after answering my questions. thanks;0
1220;Good but not for me;the product is certainly good but I hadn't done the calculations with my hiatal hernia. it bloated my stomach causing pain. I had to immediately stop hiring him. for those who don't have this problem I think it's excellent;0
1221; Calms the appetite; I've been taking 1 small pill half an hour before lunch with a full glass of water for about ten days. I have to say that it takes away my appetite and honestly I've lost cm in my waistline. I was very pessimistic at the beginning but I had to change my mind.;0
1222;Good product.;I use spirulina about twice a year for a month to cleanse my body. It is a very strong antioxidant and in my opinion the best. I chose to buy this pack of spirulina above all because it is an Italian product and has good quality with an affordable price. in fact the tablets are very well formed, they do not lose dust, they are nice and dry.;0
1223;Tasteless;I still don't see the effects of the spirulina algae. I took it for weight control and for the properties it has..I can say that the taste is not noticeable with the tablets. They arrived on time and the value for money is excellent. ..as soon as I see the results I will add a review;0
1224;No indication of use;delivery respected the terms and the product looks good in a black bag which contains three further packs where inside you will find the elastic bands. Too bad there is no booklet with exercises or any indications to make the best use of them. ;0
1225;Fitness elastic bands;I received the item very quickly as described but....without the e-book which was subsequently sent to me via email in PDF with 50 pages to print. Too bad I don't have the ability to print them. beware of those who don't have a printer!!!;0
1226; Disappointed poor quality and durability; a disappointment, very delicate tips that wear out after a few passes (even though 3/4 additional ones are supplied in the package) after a very short time they no longer write even the finest tip still remains very thick for the most delicate joints small and immediate cleaning of the tile that is stained is necessary. 4 eg no nails to make a section of tile 60cm high by 2 m long. Be careful first clean and degrease the joints carefully. Not recommended.;0
1227; Random sizes; product also made discreetly but the sizes are made just at random since I took the perl for a 70 kg girl and it doesn't fit even with force although the perl should cover up to 75 kg so I feel forced to return the product since we're not there at all. If you ever buy them, take at least 2 sizes larger;0
1228; Recalled product, tested and returned; two stars out of courtesy, the product arrived very pitifully packaged and arrived inside an envelope. I open the bag and a strange rotten smell comes out from inside, the material is poor and gives off unpleasant odors. I took an M for my size but the shirt goes up from the chest and is very tight from the chest down and very loose but with an S I would have difficulty fitting my arms into it. I do not recommend purchasing it because the poor quality materials used are not worth the price.;0
1229;I wouldn't buy it again;it's absolutely not at the same level as the original ones and for the 8 euro difference I don't think it's worth it. let's say it's better than one bought at the market stalls but for 23 I would have expected more. slightly too large earbuds for my ears.;0
1230;Everything good but low sound quality;for the task they have to carry out they are perfect. commands respond promptly and phone calls are comfortable and clear. but don't expect much sound for music. the volume is much higher than the originals and therefore they are more efficient.;0
1231;You don't need to recharge them or connect them to the device; I wanted earphones that always worked without having to recharge them, they work fine, they feel very loud and therefore need to be adjusted. I'm surprised by how ergonomic the headphones are, you have them on and you don't notice them, fully satisfied;0
1232;They last a week;kept in your pocket like the original ones they lasted a week: some wires have detached from the controls and it no longer regulates the volume. very disappointed. the sound was good but a week's duration is unacceptable.;0
1233;Earphone covers;It would be a perfect item if not for the earphone covers which come off easily and get lost making it impossible to use. they should be supplied as spares but they aren't there. however it can be solved with a micro drop of Attak or other liquid adhesive after which you have the best pair of earphones of all those I have tried.;0
1234; Good value for money; ear piece a little larger than the Apple original;0
1235;They do not deserve praise. Low perceived quality. High price; the perceived quality of these headphones is not dissimilar to those that you can find not for sale in the markets at much lower prices. It is better to buy the original ones by spending a little more or the real commercial ones by spending less.;0
1236; 👌 They are recognized without problems by 📱 iPhone 12 Pro and 📱 the microphone during calls can hear us clearly without having to raise our voice too much, the buttons placed together with the microphone to raise and lower the volume are also comfortable, with the soft rubber pads supplied they are quite comfortable in my opinion a good alternative to the original® without spending a fortune, hello thank you; the perceived quality of these headphones is not dissimilar to those that you can find not for sale in the markets at much lower prices. It is better to buy the original ones by spending a little more or the real commercial ones by spending less.;0
1237;No compatibility problems with iPhone 11;since Apple recently chose to market its products without a charger and without earphones, I ordered the Aiwons earphones to use them with iPhone 11. Overall the product showed good build quality and audio quality sufficiently. The earphones are equipped with a lighting connector and are MFI certified. They are fully compatible with iPhone 11 and as soon as they are connected they are detected as an original product. The construction level obtained with plastic materials assembled with care and attention is good. which is inserted into the ear is produced in rigid plastic but is covered in soft transparent silicone. The earphones have their strength in ergonomics. They are well shaped and fit precisely into the ears where they remain stably positioned thanks to the aforementioned silicone coating. the shape and materials used also guarantee decent acoustic insulation. Along the connection cable there is a controller equipped with three multifunction buttons that allow you to manage music (volume management and track management) and calls (accept and end calls ). On the controller there is also a microphone useful for making calls. From an audio point of view, the earphones have sufficient performance obtained with balanced highs, medium and lows and with a volume that even reaches high volumes. There is no shortage of distortions at high volumes. call management is satisfactory. the interlocutor's voice is clearly perceived and the user's voice is equally clearly perceived. currently the selling price of the item is equal to 21.99 sold by a third-party seller and shipped by Amazon which I consider in line with the quality and characteristics detected.------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- ------Hoping to have provided you with useful support for your purchases, I greet you.;0
1238; Good bass and mids. Highs can be improved. An excellent alternative to the originals. I'll tell you why...;iphone mfi certified earpops headphones with lightning co nonector provide volume and microphone control compatible with iphone 7/8/x/xr/xs/11 supports all ios systems.i have an iphone xr but for e ipad mini 4 and I wanted to try these earphones as an alternative to the originals. I'll tell you right away that for the price paid they are a good compromise. the material they are made of is discreet, pleasant to the touch and has an elegant and lightweight ergonomic design in-ear that protects from external noise. The lows are good and the highs are less pleasant in the mids. However, the listening experience is positive. They are not the best for listening to loud music but they are excellent for calls. The earphones are designed for iPhone, iPad or iPod. Works with all devices that have a light-ing connector and support iOS 10 or later. They are compatible with iPhone 11/11 Pro / iPhone X / XS / XS but for / XR iPhone 8 and 8 Plus / 7 and 7 Plus iPad Pro / Mini 4 / Air 2. One of the strong points of this product is the ergonomic design based on the shape of the ear. if you go to the gym and go jogging, don't worry, the earcups remain secure. They are also resistant to sweat and light rain. With the three buttons on the controller you adjust the volume, answer and end calls/use Siri, play/pause/go back and forth with the tracks of the musical pieces. For just over 20 euros it is an excellent product without too many demands. The shipping was on time and the package arrived intact. I am part of Amazon's Vine program. This product was sent to me for free in exchange for an objective and impartial honest review. Neither Amazon nor the seller or manufacturer can influence a vine item. I try in my reviews to do my best to give an objective opinion to the reader. I hope I have done it this time too. Thank you for having read me. bye and see you next time.;0
1239; Good cover but with some flaws; arrived on time and compliant with the description. the quality seems pretty good to me. the only flaws are the upper part of the cover which does not adhere perfectly and occasionally comes off and the lower part which instead adheres too firmly so when I have to remove the case to clean it or for other reasons it is a little uncomfortable.;0
1240;I thought it was top instead...;when it arrived I was very happy because the product is indeed made of silicone but not the kind that creates so much grip that you can't put it in your pocket. Unfortunately, however, the grip on the upper part of the case is a bit slow and I risked losing it several times. Furthermore, the small carabiner broke after just two days of use. really shame.;0
1241;Terrible freebuds pro cover!;when it arrived I was very happy because the product is indeed made of silicone but not the kind that creates so much grip that you can't put it in your pocket. Unfortunately, however, the grip on the upper part of the case is a bit slow and I risked losing it several times. Furthermore, the small carabiner broke after just two days of use. really shame.;0
1242;It doesn't suck ANYTHING;good morning dad good morning mom today we're talking about this fabulous product with truly excellent quality. the package consists of: 1 case 1 instruction booklet in Italian and other languages 3 nozzles for various aspirations 1 nasal aspirator 1 body of the suction chamber 1 anti-reflux cover of the suction chamber 1 collection chamber 1 sealing ring 1 power cable Observations: in my opinion avoid using the power 3 could be very annoying for the child. The fantastic thing about this nasal aspirator which emits lights and sounds trying to distract the little one is being able to aspirate the nose in a simpler and less tiring way. The positive thing is that it can be disassembled a lot easily to be able to clean it internally so as to avoid mold inside the container: pay attention to the very fragile container, try to handle it with as much caution as possible since unfortunately it is made of plastic and could break and not be handled.;0
1243; In short, excellent nasal aspirator, ideal for newborns but also for slightly older children. I am using it with my 3 to 9 year old son and I feel great thanks also to the music and the lights it emits to distract, equipped with a display that indicates the three levels available and the battery level. I think the price is excellent given the good materials used so in my opinion an excellent product and I recommend it;this case arrived without a carabiner and furthermore it does not fit with the freebuds pro case because it is a millimeter smaller on one side and therefore the bottom part does not fit... I do not recommend purchasing it;0
1244;Useful outside the home but…;second product I have purchased from this brand. very useful object and meets my expectations.. 4 times out of 5 my prince doesn't have any tantrums when using it.. easy to disassemble and clean. got it at an affordable price. after 1 month of daily use the battery lasts quite a long time.. it obviously works best after nasal washing.. if not, if the mucus is dry it can't even be sucked up but for. I use the long and pointed nozzle to get to the bottom...unfortunately it's a little annoying...but it's better to have a free nose.;0
1245; Terrible product; I bought it to replace the one that connects to the vacuum cleaner. my baby was terrified only by malicious approaches! so I hoped that with this in theory being less noisy and with the music it would be less traumatic. instead he screams and despairs even with this! and considering that it doesn't suck much (the rubber tips for deep inspiration are too long and it doesn't hurt me at all, I imagine it hurts my 15 month old baby!) I went back to using the one I used before which makes a lot of noise and is uncomfortable but at least it sucks !;0
1246; Good; I was looking for a vacuum cleaner to take with me on holidays and given the reviews I tried to buy this one. if I have to compare it with the noosiboo obviously there is no comparison but the cost is rightly different too. there are 3 suction intensities but in the end I always use the strongest one for my little girl because otherwise she wouldn't suck as much. very cute, the entertainment with music and lights definitely makes cleaning your nose a little more fun. every now and then it happens to me that if I don't clean the nozzle immediately, mucus comes out the next time I aspirate. It is not the best among aspirators but it is still a valid help when you are away from home and helps to keep the baby's breathing freer.;0
1247;So and so; it's fantastic for lights and music but as a vacuum cleaner it's not the best... if there are more formed secretions and therefore not liquid it makes it really difficult to suck them up. if they are liquid, that's fine.;0
1248;Poor product;nasal aspirator with good power until it stopped working... after only 2 months you cannot change the suction power and it almost no longer aspirates anything. Unfortunately, once the return period has passed, a replacement is not possible either. shameful!!!;0
1249;Are we kidding??;On other occasions I have already pointed out a real problem with reviews. I don't understand the reason to review a product without a minimum of truth or objectivity: is Amazon asking you for a review? if you don't even know what you bought, avoid doing it...it's not like Amazon will run after you if you don't do it! but at least for once do a minimum of intelligent and sincere reviews. Let's avoid wasting the time and money of those poor wretches including myself who, by trusting your reviews (that's what they should be used for, eh!) buy these miseries and find themselves a tool to throw away. earphones? I don't care about packaging but how do you make a review based on packaging?? I purchased some earphones which at least should allow me to make good phone calls. no, those are never or rarely mentioned: what is important is that there is a nice package, the manual in 37 languages including Italian (well, pairing a pair of earphones is something for nuclear engineers!!) that doesn't fall out music can be heard during physical activity. ok for those who buy them only for that it will also be useful but leave a shred of evaluation also on the quality of the calls! I go back to the earphones: has anyone at least worn them? they don't even fit in the ear, I'll tell you... the rubber doesn't fit because the body of the earphone is squat and doesn't allow you to insert it. Well! so the sound quality? horrible! lows zero mids shrill highs let's forget about it... oh well I think then for phone calls it will be the ninth of the monsters.. yes they are, but really monsters. audio in reception pitiful on the other end they feel like my head is in a box and both I and the interlocutor hear the echo of our voice. well half an hour later I'm already in a package and returned to Amazon. I repeat, a minimum of seriousness and sincerity wouldn't hurt if earphones suck, why praise them? or have you never worn a shred of earphones and these seem out of the blue to you? in this case avoid leaving ridiculous reviews.;0
1250; An excellent gift idea for this Christmas.; Headphones with an excellent quality/piece ratio. Compared to another model of the same brand purchased previously, this one reaches a higher volume. The high and medium frequencies are heard quite well while in the bass it is more noticeable that it is an economical model. certainly suitable for making calls, they are also not bad for listening to music. obviously if you are looking for high fidelity you have to aim for much more expensive products. It is very convenient that it pauses if you remove the right earphone. The touch controls are very effective. The case is beautiful and compact.;0
1251; I don't recommend them; apart from the approximate construction quality, they have none of the operational defects, for example it very often happened to me that they were paired with the smartphone in the case (obviously charged) probably due to a defect in the cover, imagine the discomfort when answering the phone without knowing that the headphones are paired the lag when playing games is terrible the audio is low and in ambient noise conditions the sounds reproduced are not audible last but not least they are neither comfortable nor stable you always have to keep putting them back okay.;0
1252; VERY DISAPPOINTING; I was looking for a pair of cheap bluetooth headphones that managed to satisfy me and after seeing various reviews online I decided to buy this model. Well what can I say, this time Bluedio has really outdone itself (I had already bought products from them). The headphones arrive in very simple packaging together with spare rubber tips. The headphones are rechargeable both via USB-C cable and wirelessly and the charging lasts a really long time (let's say 3 recharges of the headphones thanks to the bo for and the headphones When charged, they last 5/6 hours of music listening. To conclude, the audio is very full-bodied and you don't hear any interference typical of Bluetooth headphones. Quality/price 9/10 The headphones arrive including manuals in various languages including Italian. ;0
1253; good for the price; I bought them because I could use a coupon so the price was good. the sound quality isn't that great. few bass. I don't have much to say about battery life because I don't use them much. Bluetooth keeps the distance quite well. if it is not possible to use some discount coupons and you want medium-high sound quality, it is preferable to turn to other products.;0
1254; A scam; scandalous metallic sound even at maximum you can't hear high low frequencies absent... completely devoid of the new audio codecs present on 10 headphones! old headphones that sound like a 1980s radio! to buy only if you like very slow wireless charging! whoever writes are excellent must have some personal interest or has never had headphones in his life. product to be withdrawn from sale. not even given as a gift, it's worth it! bluedio never again!;0
1255; very bad. the sound and the earphones; the earphones are absolutely not noise canceling the ear tips are very small and therefore fall off the wireless charging does not work. furthermore, the earphones are all dirty and the box appears to be open even though he clumsily tried to close it. so they are used and I will return them;0
1256; Unstable connection; unfortunately it doesn't work or not at all, the connection fails and if I moved within a meter of the phone I couldn't hear anything. I asked for a return. Too bad because the shape was comfortable in the ear. Unfortunately mine were defective, it can also happen.;0
1257; Bluedio bluetooth earphones; decent sound quality. Sometimes one of the earphones goes off and with a lot of patience I delete it from the Bluetooth device list and then re-pair it or turn them off and on again without infamy or praise. good value for money.;0
1258; bluetooth headphones; I didn't have a great feeling with these headphones, I'm also not used to wearing them usually, I did it to try and in any case the normal old wired earphones fit me better. these always seem to tend to fall out of the ears...I think I will use them very little;0
1259;Returned 15 minutes later;not even 5 minutes after unpacking them...but the headset detuned and turned off. the one continues to play even if I take it away from my ear. I try again...and it happens again. returned started only 15 minutes after receiving them. the audio is not that bad but if as soon as they are activated there are no problems something doesn't add up.;0
1260;Surprise!!!!!!!!;excellent for the job, price at which I got them. They are well made as they are in ear, they fit perfectly as well. beautiful and practical to put on and take off mac the real surprise is in the sound deep bass but not pumped highs the right one if you have quality audio tracks it will give you ninth satisfaction.;0
1261; It doesn't work in stereo only Right or Left; there is no way to make it work in stereo. the audio can only be heard on one of the two right or left earphones, never together. despite having tried the reset dozens of times as explained in the manual . I think I will ask for a return;0
1262;Very functional. But how does the charging case work?; arrived today! very beautiful, useful and functional. The touch buttons work well and are comfortable. you can hear both the sound of music and phone calls well! However, I didn't understand if I can use the case to store and carry the earphones around even if they are 90% charged... or if it is preferable to put them in the case only when they are discharged. Is it better to avoid constantly loading and removing them? thanks;0
1263;Left earphone not working;arrived in the right time but upon opening I immediately noticed that the left earphone was not working. I did various tests hoping it was a Bluetooth pairing problem but this is not the case because it does not work;0
1264; Interesting Bluetooth earphones; purchased super discounted at 17.99 but after using them I feel like saying that it was worth buying them even at full price. The audio quality is really excellent from both earphones. The battery life is 8 hours really if not more but the headphones can be recharged in the charging case up to 4 times thus arriving at the 30/40 hours declared by the seller which are therefore real. In the charging case it lasts approximately 1 and a half hours while recharging completely charging case takes longer for obvious reasons. understand that the charging of the charging case is complete the green light emitted by the case from flashing becomes solid. the charging cable uses a classic USB compatible with all classic phone chargers, the only note being that as usual this cable is short. the headphones are short, comfortable and equipped with 6 earpiece rubbers so you can have a spare in case of loss or wear .the headphones are equipped with intelligent touch control so with simple touches clearly explained in the leaflet you can raise/lower the volume change songs activate Siri etc. the only flaw? I can't pair them with my MacBook Air 2020 while they pair with the iPhone. I read other reviews in which other people were able to pair them but this is not my case because I can pair other Bluetooth headphones and this is the reason for the 4 stars.;0
1265; In line with the price paid;" ""the quality of the headphones is in line with the price paid (around 17 euros). Not suitable for listening to music as the audio is rather ""mixed"" with very weak bass. as far as phone calls are concerned, I work quite well. clear voice in the headphones and even the person receiving the phone hears quite clearly, unlike other models I have tried (even more expensive ones) where the voice of the interlocutor arrives decidedly muffled and booming. therefore promoted as far as concerns phone calls (even with a single headset) while not recommended when used to listen to music.""";0
1266; excellent; initially I couldn't find the exact housing for my ear... they often fell out then after some tests I found the perfect position (which is the one with the stem almost at nose height in my case).. .good battery life and decent sound;0
1267; Improve the Bluetooth connection and I repeat the audio is very acceptable; much credit to the delivery guy who does a great job the item was not to be ignored the packaging as always protected but the item itself did not satisfy me the audio is good but the connection is of little radius after 5 meters it jumps.;0
1268;Smart working;"I bought these headphones mainly for working from home"""" I needed headphones that were not long and bulky and these were perfect for me. The strong points are: they are not long and therefore take up less space, the light of the LED is bright white so you can see it really well when it does the recognition with the other headphones (I was worried about the fact that it was white but you can see it really well) then it's very nice that if you put the right headphones on the entire system pauses the touch part is very precise and the audio is of high quality obviously considering the fact that they don't cost 150 euros but for the use that I have to do at this moment of smart working it works very well. I also tried them with my smart TV and it didn't work for me. I haven't had any problems even after hours of wearing them while watching a rather long film in astrahaaaa they charge quite quickly minus the base but they last a long time.""";0
1269;Good but uncomfortable...;I must say that the sound is discreet, the cancellation is nothing for me (compared to the Airpods Pro) they are a little uncomfortable they don't adhere well to the ear easy pairing with the phone the quality especially of the packaging is not very good there is battery life and wireless charging...;0
1270; Nice design, terrible functioning; with unstable and uncertain connection. with macbook pro difficulty connecting even after several resets. wireless charging is very practical. good audio quality both in and out. I wouldn't buy them again;0
1271;Not recommended;unfortunately I find myself extremely dissatisfied with the purchase of this item. initially the product also seemed of high quality, I must say that the sound quality is good but less than a month after purchase I find myself with headphones that work intermittently and very often I even struggle to connect. refund requested;0
1272;Comfortable, shame about the sound;I waited to review because I wanted to try them for longer. I don't like the sound it seems like it goes from one headphone to another sometimes you don't always hear it at the same time. I also thought I would pay less but no... but they are comfortable, they don't hurt the ear at all if you keep them on for a long time and the battery holds up well.;0
1273; Product details not complete; the 2 parts that make up the headset do not fit together perfectly and there is a crack that makes me doubt whether it remains waterproof. Then it is not specified that the case is only and exclusively recharged using the supplied cable and not with other criguardo type cables also use discreet sound both in calls and music. battery life yet to be seen.;0
1274; NOT compatible with Fiat Punto Evo; my nuva kuga had yellow halogen lights as high beams which were not exactly beautiful as the entire optical group was white LED light. I purchased these lights and I must say that I was surprised. They are h11 but they also fit as h9 without any problem in fact they fit perfectly and provide a very strong and bright light at the price offered and a truly satisfied real deal;0
1275; LED lamps with cooling fan; the LEDs are very well made, the body of the lamp is all aluminum with active dissipation (with cooling fans), the light beam is very linear like the halogen one without bothering people who are not after you. I can't say much about durability because I've been using them for less than a month but I think they will be very long-lived if I update the review. the only flaw in my opinion is the price should be a bit lower otherwise everything is excellent I recommend them;0
1276;Product below expectations.;I bought them on a whim to give an extra touch to my car and for now they are perfect, the 6000k can all be seen and even the cold light has an edge compared to the warm one!! if you want to improve your car even a little, give yourself this gift and with 40 you'll have a treat (they're all worth it);0
1277;Not of much importance;I'll have to return them! It makes a nice white light but on my 508 lenticular I don't like the result as they are not very intense and on the left side they are practically absent. I think it's the lenticulate's fault...maybe. However, I want to try something more powerful. I tried something else that covers 360° and it improved a little but only slightly.. the problem is the lenses I have.;0
1278; h7 car lights; I'm not very satisfied with these because it says that they are simple to assemble while it took me a long time as they didn't adapt to my car. then I don't know if mine are defective but they don't emit a lot of light as it says in the description (12000lm) because I have other h7 lights and they give off a little more light than these.;0
1279; Excellent for high beams; I can't give my best opinion as they were mounted as high beams. Beautiful white and powerful light but I repeat I'm talking about high beams. I tried to clear the car in front so I could overtake him, well the guy must have taken it I'm afraid I found a beastly beam of light on me... the effect is beautiful. For the quality, in my opinion it's a bit poor, too much plastic. what I noticed is that the power supply that is usually found on LED lamps is missing. I don't know if this could penalize its duration or quality. I would buy them again but always as high beams and not as low beams, I'm afraid they won't last too long.;0
1280; Not good for my car; I didn't have the opportunity to try them since they arrived without a component needed to mount the headlights. I looked at the instructions and also the illustrative video but in the latter, different headlights from the model that were used were used. I ordered (h7) additionally in the product description there is no indication of having to purchase an additional part to be able to mount the aforementioned headlights;0
1281; adapters that do not fit; unfortunately I cannot give 4/5 stars, I was unable to mount them because despite having read to the contrary, the adapters do not fit in the headlight of my 2014 Citroen C3 Picasso HDI. I tried to write if there are any some compatible adapters but at the moment no response if it ever exists as an adapter I would like to buy it. too bad......I would have liked to see them installed and give the real rating;0
1282; Fitted on Benelli Trk502x; super fast shipping, mounted without difficulty on the motorbike without any modification to the rubber protection caps. the brightness is excellent, we will see how long it lasts over time. for now I can say that it was a good purchase.;0
1283; Mounted on grande punto 2007; very good brightness, easy to assemble and on my car there has been no lighting error. One flaw is that on my headlights after using it for about 1 hour after assembly following the instructions it has created a halo on the chrome of the headlight due to the heat.;0
1284; Nice product, discontent; I'm quite dissatisfied with the item.. the assembly was very comfortable and the lighting that these bulbs offer is the best I've had so far.. too bad that after less than 24 hours the left bulb stopped working work ..;0
1285; Not compatible with Golf 7 cars, inform yourself carefully before purchasing; it is not the first time that I have interfaced with the beamfly brand as in the past I have tested many of their other models on different cars without having problems even months later. ;0
1286; High quality; these beamfly are excellent h7 LED lamps and are on par with other valid models available on the market such as the excellent and long-lived Koyoso ones. the light emitted is much more than double (perhaps triple) compared to that of the halogenous municipalities;0
1287;When purchasing lamps of this type it is good to know that...;before getting to the heart of the review it is necessary to warn those interested in purchasing that, due to Italian regulations, the replacement of originally fitted halogen lamps with equivalent LED lamps is not permitted and in this regard heavy sanctions are also foreseen. The justification for this ban is given by the fact that it could create problems of glare for those coming in front due to the shape of the dish not designed for the different diffusion of light emitted by the LEDs. Very fair limitation if this happened in all cases. in my no. after having mounted them for a test on my tireless third series fiat Punto I stood in front and approached with another car simulating an intersection and I didn't encounter any glare problems. In reality you are still given the possibility of mounting them but facing of appropriate checks carried out by responsible bodies after assembly by a professional who must certify correct installation and obviously the lamps must be approved. I don't know how many would be willing to carry out a procedure like this to have LED headlights on their car even if there are people who easily drive around with aftermarket LED lights without ever having dreamed of having the modification approved. I ordered the h7 version which is not the double light but the one suitable for models that have a separate high beam dish as in my case on my car. after trying them I dismantled them to avoid verbal abuse. Let's now come to the product. The power is 80 W. Color temperature of 6000° Kelvin which, translated into shades, appears as very white light without particular nuances as happens with xenon lamps. I must say that the build quality is good. they are sold in a sturdy cardboard package together with instructions, also in Italian, which however are limited only to some FAQs. Unfortunately I have not found any indication regarding approvals. They are equipped with a cooling fan as they heat up quite a lot and in any case the heatsink body has a small footprint limited both in diameter (35 mm) and depth (32 mm compared to the socket). In my case the on-board computer reports it as a burnt out bulb. The brightness is truly remarkable which, without prejudice to what has been said previously, would certainly justify the purchase. in this regard, it will be enough to take a look at the photo to understand the difference. Regarding the assembly, I did not encounter any particular difficulties given that there is not enough space behind the dish. it is necessary to know that there must be at least ten centimeters free to be able to easily insert it into the mouth of the reflector. It should also be noted that when the i is not in the seat of the reflector you will realize that you cannot reattach the locking clip, this is because it is behind the lighting part There is not only the centering disk (attachment) with the usual conectors as for normal halogen bulbs but in fact the entire dissipator block which does not allow the insertion of the clip. To be able to insert them it is necessary to rotate the disk until it it will not detach. its fixing uses the classic bayonet system. so to understand, you need to grasp the disk with two fingers, rotate the rear part of the lamp clockwise or anti-clockwise and after a few degrees of rotation the disk can be removed. since it is very hard to rotate, to avoid hurting your fingers it is best to place a cloth folded several times between your fingers and the disk. at this point you can place only the disk against the hole in the reflector, secure it with the clip and finally reinsert the lamp into the disk by pushing it slightly and turning it again in a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction. However, regarding the insertion of the bulb into the disk, I remain quite perplexed. as mentioned, by rotating in one direction or the other the disk still comes out which means that there is no limit switch that positions the lighting part correctly. with other LED lamps, the disk is removed from the body only by turning it anti-clockwise and is replaced only by turning it clockwise until you reach the stop which has the function of keeping the LEDs correctly facing, one downwards and the other upwards inside the reflector. in other words in the case in question the two LEDs could be rotated at any angle. question: is it still okay? I do not think so. Of course, the positioning can be done by looking at the bulb from the headlight glass, rotating it until the LEDs are in approximately the correct position but this seems to me to be a... er, I avoid the term. Another question that needs to be known. on the connector there are two almost invisible symbols that indicate the polarity to be respected. you need to understand which is the + and which is the - on the car's connector. obviously there is no indication of polarity on it because traditional light bulbs do not have any constraints. to be sure you can use a tester by connecting it as an ohmmeter between an unpainted metal part of the car and one of the two pins of the connector;0
1288; Excellent bulbs even if the fan...; the bulbs give off a lot of light, they are excellent, they can be easily installed without any problem with the h7 lamp holder. Nothing needs to be changed, they don't need external control units as in the case of the permanent ones, they are plug & play .the problem in my opinion is that it has none of the fans on their back to cool them. by closing the anti-splash caps of the headlights, however, I don't see how these fans can throw fresh air onto the bulb transformer, not to mention that having a moving element (a fan) is not the best. They are certainly designed well and are solid so it certainly won't give any problems. problems. If the fan were to break, the lights would simply go out, nothing would happen to the machine. Overall, I recommend excellent quality/price ratio!;0
1289;They only work without CAN-bus - Spectacular light!;they are two LED bulbs for the main headlights of the car which provide a total luminous flux of 12,000 lumens and a really important light clarity thanks to the color temperature of 6000k in white cold and with a color rendering index of 85 such as to clearly define what it illuminates. The body of the lamps is entirely made of aeronautical aluminum and they are each equipped with a fan for cooling. However, before purchasing them you must check whether your car uses or not a can-bus system. To find out, simply unplug a lamp, turn on the car, turn on the headlights and check if a fault is reported in the bulb. in this case it is not possible to use these LED bulbs unless you also buy a can-bus canceller. In summary the technical characteristics are: * socket: h7 * power: 80w total * lumen: 12000lm total * color temperature: 6000k cold white * color rendering index: 85 * protection index: ip68 the manufacturer estimates a life of 55,000 hours / 25 to noni. the price as of April 10, 2021 is 25 99 for the pair.;0
1290; Problem with switching from halogen to LED, the workshop didn't fit them for me; shipped on the scheduled date in cardboard packaging from Amazon. Shipping combined with another item. I love this system. The bulbs are contained in a very adequate cardboard box and protected with sponge. I couldn't wait to transform my headlights from halogens to LEDs. After lunch I went down to the garage armed with good will. In fact, I know how to change the bulbs when I have to. I do it myself and that's why I embarked on the project. 'business. unfortunately this time I didn't succeed, perhaps it was the rush or the fear of breaking something and I stopped but didn't lose heart and I went straight to my workshop where I asked for help for this replacement and here my embarrassment is beyond me. he didn't want to install them because according to them the car wasn't approved for LED bulbs. He told me that to fit them the approval of the car headlights would have to be updated with a transcription in the registration document and furthermore that the bulbs in question weren't approved in any case as they lacked any homologation marking valid in Italy, in short, it's quite a long process and also not very economical to be honest, it crossed my mind to try to fit them again on my way back but then I gave up because if the workshop were right I would have done an operation that wasn't legal. Now I've read a few questions about it on the internet and it seems that they were right in the workshop and that I was right not to fit them. However, I'm sorry because I still saw that they are much brighter than the ones I have. The only thing I managed to get in the workshop was the ignition test of the bulbs. For now I won't mount them if in doubt I want to ask someone authoritative and definitive something that I invite all those who find themselves in the same situation as me to do. I believe that those who already have standard LED lamps can easily replace the old ones with this product even if the lack of approval could be an obstacle in any case. at this point I don't know how to judge the product to work, it works, the light is non-existent and also strong but I haven't tried driving it but only the non-estates externally to test its functioning I will keep neutral and leave it to other more competent people to unravel the problem and I will leave the lamps in the box .I thank the Amazon Vine program which offered me to try these LED lamps even if I don't feel like using them.;0
1291; Powerful and very clear light, easy installation; inside a well-packaged and protected box you will receive the two H7 LED lamps and the related assembly instructions from the Beamfly brand, a well-known brand for car lighting. These are high-end lamps :- body in aeronautical aluminum - powerful and concentrated light beam of 12000 lumens and with a color temperature of 6000k very white and very sharp light - we also find the small low-noise cooling fan integrated on each bulb which should avoid overheating in case of use prolonged or with high ambient temperature;0
1292; Excellent product from a hardware point of view, pay attention to the dimensions of the fan; thanks to the vine program I had the opportunity to test this pair of LED lamps from Beamfly, one of the many Chinese brands that orbit in the Amazon galaxy. Even though these are produced in the East LED bulbs are made with well-made materials, the assemblies are quite precise and accurate, giving the impression of handling a product of a clearly superior class. They arrive packaged in an elegant package which shows the salient characteristic data of the product, being of the plug & play type, no need to make any modification to your car so they can be easily installed even by the most uninitiated. I had taken them to replace the halogen low beam lamps of my 2008 Lancia Delta but when installing them I realized that the body of the lamp in the rear part where it is find the cooling fan is definitely too large so the clip used to lock the bulb in position cannot be hooked, preventing it from closing correctly. I was still able to try them even though I then inevitably had to dismantle them. Even if the supporting body is made of PVC and not aluminum thanks to the presence of the very efficient and silent cooling system they don't heat up excessively in general the entire body is excellent even though more expensive than other models offered by other competitors, they are however well built and give the impression of handling a superior quality product. the light beam they generate is very wide and does not generate dark spots, in my opinion they are much brighter than a traditional halogen lamp. compatible with the majority of car models on the market, they are also equipped with an integrated cooling fan which serves to cool the LED chip. Ultimately I would certainly recommend them for their light output but pay careful attention to the dimensions to avoid unnecessarily make a return. If it doesn't work, replace it with a headlight with a 45° rotation block. There will most likely be no problems but if you intend to replace it with a headlight with a spring block, you should know that it is very difficult for you to be able to hook the spring correctly unless you it will dismantle the headlight as the size of the cooling fan has a larger diameter than the width of the clip spring. technical data sheet: power: 80w/set lumen: 12000lm/pair color temperature: 6000k cold white color rendering index: 85300% brighter of the standard halogen headlights360° adjustable beamrotatable and removable aluminum adapterwaterproof rate: ip68operating temperature: -40~+120operating voltage : 12vlongevity: >55000 hourspackage contents2 for h71 led headlight bulbsfor installation manualwhy buy them: because they are approximately 300% brighter than halogen lamps because they are plug & play type you do not need to make any modifications to your car because they are equipped with the same connection therefore you do not need to make any changes to the electrical system the lifespan is approximately five times longer than a lamp traditional halogen for a clear improvement of the light beam without dark spots. why not buy them: because in some cases the bulb is incompatible with the dimensions compared to the clip spring of some car models.*********conclusions** ********** at the time of writing the review the 12000 lumen beamfly h7 led with integrated control unit are offered at 25 99 with free one day shipping for prime customers, a price that is all in all reasonable and in line with the objective quality of the product. I would like to point out that I have always been impartial, I have never had preferential attitudes in the reviews written on the free samples received from Amazon. I therefore hope that my review was appreciated and above all that it was useful to objectively evaluate the purchase of this product. overall rating 80/100 thanks for reading me.;0
1293; Superior brightness but they are NOT APPROVED; pros: - brightness and durability superior to halogens - active dissipation with fan - integrated control unit cons: - no ECE approval - complex installation tested exclusively in the garage on Alfa Mito this is because the use of these devices Without ECE approval it would lead to heavy penalties in the event of a breakdown or in the event of an overhaul. The installation of an LED kit is legal only if the LED kit has ECE approval and if the installation is carried out by an authorized mechanical workshop. However, manual installation is complex: as it is the bulkiest device, you will have to carefully calculate the space in the headlight compartment. Furthermore, the dustproof rubber caps of the low beam should not be changed or cut so as not to obstruct the LED dissipation fans. The positive sides of the LED headlights are an active light immediately without the need to warm up, a larger and more intense light beam and a longer overall life compared to halogens and perenon;0
1294; High construction quality and innovative and more effective LED arrangement; the very beautiful and protective packaging contains the two lamps and an installation manual. The construction of the lamps is truly remarkable, they are completely made of aluminum and have a protected cable of good section by an elegant nylon sock. The cable is interspersed with a small external control unit also made of aluminum (generally not present in lower power LED lamps). The set has an IP68 waterproof rating so no problem even in case of torrential rain These bulbs have the particularity of having 18 SMD LEDs arranged around the entire circumference of the bulb and not just on two sides like the other sets. Installation is elementary, just remove the previous bulb and insert the LED bulb. Once the connect the cable, create space for it to pass through the dust cover and that's it. However, it is necessary to drill a hole of at least 20mm in the dust cover to allow the correct passage of air for the bulb cooling fan. on other models of LED bulbs, the fixing ring must first be removed from the bulb fixed in the headlight, after which the bulb is fixed by making it a quarter of a turn;0
1295;"They appear well made and simple to assemble but they are ""outlawed""!";"the product arrives in a cardboard package with a foam interior which protects the contents well. Inside we find the 2 lamps and the manual multilingual. in the manual it is written in capital letters that they are not compatible with can-bus and therefore require the presence of the canceller. the lamps are well made, have an aluminum body and are equipped with a cooling fan. the connector (at least in my case) allows for simple and very quick installation. Adapters are sold separately. The increased size of the body may not allow the lid to close correctly and therefore it may be necessary to purchase larger lids. Furthermore, the chipset must absolutely not be touched with hands and the voltage must not exceed 24v. Having clarified these aspects, it must be said that these lamps are not approved and therefore adopting them could lead to penalties or seizures. My car is about to be serviced and my electrician absolutely advised me against fitting them even after the service as they would make the car ""outlawed"". Obviously I followed the electrician's advice and preferred not to give these lamps to residents. in Italy I do not recommend purchasing for obvious reasons.";0
1296; Nothing to do with the old halogen bulbs; inside a well packaged and protected box you will receive two bulbs and the related assembly instructions from the beamfly brand, a brand that is not at all unknown in this sector, so much so that I have already been installing them on my car for a long time 2% of the bulbs (same brand but less performing model) which are performing very well so far. At first impression these bulbs appear to be a high quality product. just notice the aeronautical aluminum body to realize that the product is high-end. When I practice it I can confirm a strong and concentrated light beam. very white and very sharp light (declared temperature 6000 k). overall power is 12000 lumen. these are h4 bulbs and are high beam and low beam. particularity: there is a small cooling fan integrated on each bulb which should prevent it from overheating in case of prolonged use or with high ambient temperature. this should preserve its technical life. Installation is simple (like any light bulb, perhaps more or less complicated based on the specific model of headlight installed on the car) and suitable for those who don't even know how to change a light bulb! To conclude, it is a well-made product and that seems to last for a long time. It is also IP68 certified and the light generated is powerful and above all clear. No problems highlighted so far. excellent product. price not available at the time of writing this review (February 2021) so I cannot express an opinion on the value for money of the item in question.;0
1297; Good intensity of light to check the duration in time; this is a pair of LED car lights with H4 connection. The LED lights arrive in a cardboard package with a sponge inside which protects the two bulbs from possible impacts or by noni during transport. Inside the package we find the two h4 light bulbs and a well-illustrated instruction manual that will explain step by step how to install the light bulbs correctly. The manual is also in Italian. The technical specifications of the light bulbs they are the following in the case of the h4 model color temperature 6000k light source csp 3570 voltage 9v- 16v bulb life 55000 hours material used aluminum classification ip68 lumens 12000 I had the opportunity to mount these bulbs on my car and I must admit that the difference with the classic bulbs is notable in the material with which They are built and appear to be of good quality. The installation procedure was very simple and immediate, in fact I was able to connect them in less than 10 minutes. In summary I was satisfied with the intensity of light and the construction quality of this bulb with regards to its duration. I will update the review as time passes in case I also find anomalies or defects. I hope I have been of help in choosing this product;0
1298;The problem is the approval!;I wanted to replace the light bulbs of my car which, being old, uses halogen ones with LED bulbs in order to have a more diffused and certainly better light. They are produced in China, a package arrives with the two inside light bulbs well placed and protected by a sponge, the cable to be connected is approximately 10 cm long and is equipped with a fan at the end to cool them. the light they emit is optimal and very homogeneous compared to before, the visibility is considerably improved and increased. reading other reviews I I came across one that spoke of a characteristic approval that I had ignored, I asked my mechanic and he actually said that it does not have a ninth approval as there is no symbol attesting to it. Overall I consider them very valid unfortunately as they are not approved and in the event of check we will certainly find ourselves at fault and subject to a report therefore I think I will rate them with an average between one star for lack of approval and 5 stars for functionality in order to make you aware of what you are purchasing. thank you... if the review is was appreciated.;0
1299; BEAM NOT VERY UNIFORM; price not available at the review date so the product itself is excellent in terms of construction materials, no imperfections and really well made. It doesn't cause any problems with canbus errors (very common on fiats for example) so don't worry. the light beam is very strong, it certainly won't be 12000lm but 10000lm yes (I already have 12000lm mounted on another car). The fans can be heard a little with the engine off and could be annoying to the most fussy. after assembly, make sure that they are working and always carry out a periodic check. The fans are essential to prevent the lamp from heating up too much which in extreme cases could even catch fire. I also remind you of one important thing: these bulbs are not approved for use in road but only off-road so you could be subject to administrative sanctions in the event of an inspection. the negative evaluation is due to a single factor unfortunately the light beam has too many shadowed or poorly lit areas I tried to rotate them (they are not the first ones I have mounted ) but there is obviously a design problem behind it.;0
1300;A beautiful light;sockets for my 3008 but immediately removed because they didn't work well before attributing the problem to the lamps I tested them on the ka here I must say that they immediately went well, very easy to assemble and of the perfect shape here the problem has disappeared especially in the evening, in fact, the lights are a fantastic ice white, plus I didn't find any shaded areas. The possibility of using them gave me excellent visibility without problems. Finally, I also polished the headlights to have a perfect vision. They arrive in a well-kept box and you immediately understand their excellent quality even before using them, unlike other lamps it also has small fans to cool and reduce the heat that could be released.;0
1301; Clear and sharp vision; I will be brief in describing this product. It is shipped well packaged in simple packaging. They are made with good materials and are simple to install. They provide a very intense light and are IP68 waterproof. The light is always constant without changes of any kind. The LED technology allows much greater visibility with a power of 80 watts. The color temperature is quite cold which guarantees a sharp light and clear vision. The manufacturer precisely states 6000. Price of around 30 euro voucher, we hope they will be successful over time.;0
1302; EXCELLENT KIT AND NICE BEAM OF LIGHT... NORMAL PRICE; excellent h7 LED lights from Beamfly which is an excellent brand. Let's see how long they last, so inside the package we find two lamps with an H7 connection, 80 watts and 12,000 lumens per pair. The brightness is quite good. They are made very well. The structure is made of metal and has a small cooling fan. What I like about the product, good price, excellent light. designed and excellent fan;0
1303; 🚘 I didn't expect such brilliance ✨ and brightness 💡 no need 🔧 for control units or modifications 👌 ; hi everyone, I didn't expect so much brilliance and brightness to illuminate the road well even in low light conditions, much higher than the rankings of filament bulbs installed on a 2008 suzuki swift with h4 connection I didn't have any problems with errors and I didn't have to make any changes since it has the normal header for the lamps, there's no need for additional control units, it doesn't have a small fan for cooling, they are IP68 water resistant, hello thanks;0
1304; Excellent high performance non-CanBus lamps; I mounted a pair of 8000 lumen lamps, the difference in light is not very visible but this product appears to be cool, equipped with cooling fans in the rear part, a very well made matt black aluminum heatsink. the lamp contains 4 high performance LEDs, they are suitable for h4 connections. it is not canbus so either mount a resistor or you have to disable the faulty bulb alarm otherwise it will always be signaled to you. for the rest the product seems excellent, we will see how it behaves with the time.;0
1305; They reach far but do not have much longevity.; Replacement bulbs at a good price. The brightness is very high and the vision reaches further than normal night lights. They are perfect. The only flaw is that it does not have a very long life given the quality but it is a good compromise to save something.;0
1306; Nice product; a good product nothing to say... the light is really strong and clear I wanted to attach the photo but it doesn't make it... we can easily recommend the product only attention because it has built-in fans so there must be space behind the light bulb to close the lid once everything has been installed..it doesn't need any type of control unit as I'm used to them even being less powerful;0
1307;A 2021 LED headlight in a 2012 car;taken without much pretension only because it was on offer but as soon as it was installed I had a nice surprise........they look like bulbs from a new car generation true show. the only flaw is that the control unit gives me an error but with that light that makes none of these damn lights on, I have a Skoda Yeti;0
1308; Not recommended purchase; terrible product. the masks that arrived are not the ones in the photo. the markings do not comply, especially the CE mark which appears to be China Esport. contacted Amazon support and reported non-compliant item. purchase not recommended;0
1309; Dirt from the worst China; I don't know how you can review such a poor product with 5 stars. It's really rubbish advertised as being made in Italy but for me only (perhaps) the seller is Italian. dimensions of the Chinese face mask, very poor quality and comfort, I would go into more detail about certification and more. Amazon loses face. provide in time.;0
1310;Disappointing purchase. Refund requested.; the certification and brand are applied with a stamp and are not printed in the same way as passing with a slightly damp hand discolored the entire stamp. all 50 masks do not have the same brand. requested refund as they do not conform to the description and are unreliable.;0
1311;I doubt the reliability of these masks.;the box containing the masks is in poor condition, dented and even a little torn in a couple of places.On the outside of the box it is recommended to read the instructions for use which are absent inside.Unfortunately not I can return the item but if I could I would. I am not at all satisfied with my purchase. The manufacturers should be more careful since it is a sanitary item.;0
1312; Avoid; the two writings on the mask on one side with the certification number and on the other with the company name are so engraved that they are totally transparent. Therefore, there is a legitimate doubt about the actual filtering power. What is certain however is the absolute inefficiency of the attack of the elastic. first three masks out of three after an hour the elastic detached from the mask. advice. avoid the purchase. Not trusting I have to buy more masks again.;0
1313;Sorry, easy failure; one expects a product made in Italy but instead one finds a Chinese product and not even of excellent quality. Unfortunately it is the second time I have tried products from this seller and for the second time I feel scammed. 49 I would have bought so many surgical masks to carry them in my coffin instead I bought 50 masks which are worth as much as a surgical one and cost 5 times;0
1314; ABSOLUTELY NOT TO BE BUYED!!!!; it is the third time I have purchased these masks... unfortunately these 50 masks ordered have nothing to do with the previous ones!!!! practically transparent, very thin and with the various perforated codes on the masks ... so explain to me what protection they can give? I would say zero protection at a high price!!! unfortunately they cannot be returned otherwise I think the supplier would be full of returns!!!! you are not playing with people's health !!! !for me zero stars...unfortunately I am obliged to mark at least 1 in order to publish my review...!!!!!;0
1315; I'd like to return it because it's bad but it seems it's not possible; the package arrived unannounced even though inside the large Amazon package I tried a mask. The writing made in Italy gave me confidence but the thickness of the mask is really thin and doesn't have a smell. really unpleasant enough to give a headache. I would like to return the product but it seems it is not possible. We do not recommend it also because it is a healthcare product that should be used to protect our health! Instead of printing the name of the manufacturing company, think about making a quality product;0
1316;In theory they are fine but...;in theory the masks are good with certification and everything in order. Unfortunately, however, one in two of the elastics break and this makes the mask unusable (they detach from the point where they are, the elastic is glued to the mask). of the first ten at least half were thrown away because when you're out and about and it breaks you can't do much. and thinking of fixing them is madness considering that it is a product that has stringent health regulations. It's a shame because the price of the pack of 50 was excellent. but if I have to throw away half...;0
1317; TINY L UNUSABLE; the elastics are very short, they bend the ears and cannot be held on for more than half an hour, they literally cause pain. I had bought the pack of 20 from the same brand in the past and they were excellent but these are really tiny, unusable. it is possible to return it for 40 euros wasted!;0
1318;Good but...;"the masks seem to do their job from a filtering point of view even if out of 50 in the package there are always some impaired ones. personally on a box that just arrived I already counted 2 which had to end up in the 'undifferentiated it seems that there is not much attention given to the assembly. I have not changed the elastic since before it was too short and very hard. Personally I found them better before as they adhered perfectly without leaving holes. Now the elastic is too ""generous "" and you are forced to use hooks to keep it in place but in any case it does not adhere perfectly as before. Apparently there are no rip-offs on the certification, it is a CE 2841";0
1319; Disappointing purchase; very tight elastic on many masks to the point of not being able to wear them. on others the elastic is fine but the quality/price ratio is terrible if you consider having to use a double mask (putting a surgical one on top) to avoid wasting it.;0
1320;Bad purchase;bad purchase. stamp affixed to masks in such a way that it is smudged at the first trace of humidity. also size for children. very short elastics and even the mask compared to other ffp2 ones are a good cm shorter. I can't evaluate the efficiency but if it gives me a lot.... don't buy!;0
1321; Italian product to be checked for suitability; item arrived very quickly. Excellent quality and price only if they are actually as described. Once the box is opened there is no internal explanation. I have certification which specifies that they are suitable. There are stamps on the masks which are not all uniform. not even tested to be able to judge if in doubt you return it;0
1322; 1/3 of the masks were broken.; Despite seeing the Italian product I have to say that it is very poor. out of 50 masks, 17 had broken elastic already in the packaging. it seems like a problem due to the machinery during production.;0
1323;Big disappointment;unfortunately the masks did not prove to be up to the task as I believe they do not protect at all. the reason for what I say comes from the fact that the brand of the product and its certification, unlike the image of the product in the window, is not simply printed on the fabric but is engraved so deeply as to make that part of the mask completely transparent . furthermore, what is engraved on both sides of the mask is very extensive, compromising its primary function, i.e. protection. It's a shame because the rest of the mask seems well made. Amazon's shipping and assistance service is always impeccable and efficient.;0
1324; Masks with holes; purchased on June 27th. after using them for a week yesterday while I was opening a single package by chance I looked at the incisions on the mask which are transparent but obviously must be closed with a filter film. I realized with dismay that they had holes;0
1325;THE USUAL ITALIAN STORAGE;well done to them for managing to get my husband to buy this product!!in addition to the smell which makes it impossible to wear them... there are some writings engraved which leave little doubt about the effectiveness of the product itself in fact the fabric is so thin that it cannot act as a safety device... we trusted the made in Italy production but it is clear that it is a decoy. If it were a serious company among other things it would accept the return but not they don't do it otherwise they wouldn't even sell one anymore!! what they didn't take into consideration is that people use it as a safety device for their health like my husband who is immunosuppressed and not for beauty. strange that amazon endorses these suppliers... metalsud lo catto srl;0
1326;Good masks and good value for money.;I was very happy with these masks. they are all individually sealed. the size was perfect for me, the elastics are resistant and so are the masks themselves. in my opinion excellent value for money: 2 weeks before Christmas I bought the package from 50 to 29 euros, shipping included. the delivery was very punctual (indeed early) and impeccable as always. recommended!;0
1327;Comfortable, not bad!;I've been buying these masks for some time now and all in all I've always found them to be good or at least better than many others I've tried. - it doesn't have a bad smell which is already a lot for me! - they're quite large, that's not to say so they fit well for everyone. - the elastic bands are perhaps a little too soft because the mask does not always adhere to the face perfectly but at least it doesn't hurt the ears at all. - they are packaged in individual sealed bags but are placed in the box a little bit at a time. in bulk and for this reason some bend. however when wearing them they regain their correct shape.;0
1328; Sicura Masks; I have ordered masks from Sicura other times and have always been happy with them. This time it went differently. The package arrived open as shown in the photo. 48 masks instead of 50! I counted them 4 times to be sure. therefore 0.77 cents per mask instead of 0.74. I doubt that the 2 missing masks will be credited to me on the next order. I am very satisfied with the product but the service and seriousness are equally important.;0
1329;Nice product although not cheap but the elastics are too short!;in my opinion this is a top quality product. however the elastics are too tight and after a few hours of continuous use it really hurts. and even using the appropriate clips from behind the neck (which are not included) the mask really pulls tight. nice product but for this reason I don't recommend it to those with large faces.;0
1330;Bad yet another mask with detached elastics.;disappointed with the fourth purchase given the excellent product received previously, I reordered them but this time several masks are still unusable due to the elastics not securely fixed to the mask. despite everything the seller was not at all concerned about this situation. a sign that he doesn't care. I will buy elsewhere with my money.;0
1331;size;I noticed a difference between ffp2 and ffp3. the ffp2 are slightly smaller and the elastics are short. if the masks were a few millimeters larger and the elastics a couple of millimeters longer they would not bother behind the ears and above all they would not leave noticeable red marks on the skin. However, they are not the first ones I have bought from this brand which I find good but every time it is always a question mark because every purchase I make is always different.;0
1332;They look good but tight elastic;I bought these masks for my mother who has to wear them for 8 hours while working. the masks seem to be of good quality, I wouldn't even know how to test their effectiveness. the flaw is that they are a little uncomfortable so the elastic bands are tight and for long periods of time they become difficult to bear;0
1333;Too big and they remain too loose;these masks are huge and therefore when anyone wearing them, a man or woman with a normal face, the mask remains large and therefore useless for protecting the wearer. I have tried them both my husband and my father all with different face shapes but nothing remains off to anyone.;0
1334;They pull on the ears; the mask is excellent;0
1335;There is no glue on the elastics; you take the mask out of the package, open it, pull the elastics behind your ears and after 2 or 3 times doing it...ting! an elastic comes off. I solved it with a drop of attack on the attachment of the elastics and the mask but that doesn't really work well.;0
1336; LOWER QUALITY LEVEL; Since the pandemic broke out I have always bought safe masks and have also recommended them to my family and acquaintances. but for a few months it seems to me that the quality level has dropped. Personally I notice that they no longer adhere well to my face (and not even to that of my husband who has a larger face) they don't smell strange they irritate my throat they seem lighter and often you can't read the type of mask ( ffp2) nor the certification code. Personally, I am no longer satisfied nor do I feel safer than before. I'm thinking of changing brands.;0
1337; not suitable for adults; the short elastic of the masks makes them completely unusable for adults. It's impossible to get a return so I can say that I wasted 50 euros on masks that will surely end up in the bin. I strongly advise against it. I attach photos to allow comparison with ffp2 masks from other brands.;0
1338;A little small;"arrived on time. packaged one by one so great attention to hygiene and comfortable to carry with you as a spare. I found them rather small compared to other brands and wearing them for a long time ""size"" a behind the ears.";0
1339; Disappointment; the product arrived in a damaged package, the warranty seal was cut, the number of masks did not correspond to the package number, in practice the package contained 57 masks instead of 50. I don't know if the QR code on the package should have also be reported on the individual masks packages;0
1340; Very bad to avoid; 43 masks arrived instead of 50, they are of poor quality and packaged in a package that does not correspond to the item contained. They bear the made in Italy brand but are much inferior to the cheaper masks declared to be imported.;0
1341; Purchase strongly discouraged; Purchase not recommended! regardless of their origin (certainly not made in Italy but I hope at least effective even if not compliant) they are really poorly made. the elastics break very easily and then it has an annoying smell.;0
1342;not really satisfied...;this time I'm not really satisfied. I received the package a day late (and this wouldn't even be a problem... for once it can fit) and the package arrived practically crushed, the box was broken and... thank goodness there were the sealed masks inside to one. rather than the product (which I now purchase with a certain regularity), I am decidedly dissatisfied with the courier.;0
1343;Good product;delivery was made on time. I had already purchased these masks and found them to be of good quality. they are individually wrapped. If I really have to find a flaw, the elastic bands around the ears are a little tight.;0
1344;But before selling them did they try to wear them?;the elastics are too short and rough, impossible to wear them for more than a few minutes.the materials and workmanship seem good.the markings are correct.the certifying body is Turkish.the manufacturer pretends to be for Italian but the dimensions of the masks more suitable for an oriental face and the packaging of the single mask not exactly flawless makes me think that the origin is Chinese like many other similar products. Not recommended purchase;0
1345;The strap often comes off; the workmanship of the masks seems good but there is the problem that often arises of the strap coming off. no small problem considering that with this package alone it has happened many times and you have to have more than one spare mask always with you. terrible purchase;0
1346; ffp2 masks; good quality product. but a doubt remains about the characters imprinted with CE marks and the various identifying numbers. does the print make the insulation of the mask less effective ???I'm afraid so;0
1347;FFP2 masks;I think it would have been a good product, too bad I can't use them. elastic bands that are too short and impossible to wear due to the pain it causes in the ears. the mask pulls on the face as well as on the ears.;0
1348; Excellent but short elastics.; I give you 4 stars because the product is excellent but please lengthen the elastics. I opened the second box of 50 but the elastics are too short. If you have already corrected the problem I will buy a new box. photo you can see the difference between the old and new model, the new one has heat-sealed writings. Thanks, good work. I repeat, the product is excellent. I can't wait to give you the fifth star.;0
1349; FFP2 mask, incorrect quantity, unsatisfactory quality; purchased for the second time as we enjoyed the first one. Unfortunately, the second purchase did not go as well as the previous one. different product with unpleasant odor - impossible to wear for a long time. above all, 41 arrived instead of 50. unfortunately the product is not suitable for return.;0
1350;Good but light;the masks come in good packaging, individually bagged, the elastic bands are well proportioned, the fabric is good, I'm not coming! no smell but unlike other masks purchased in the pharmacy they are lighter.;0
1351; Safe FFP2 masks; good product, elastic not too tight for women while for men they could pull slightly, creating a slight protruding ears effect. They cover the nose-mouth area well and has an underwire to adjust on the bridge of the nose. Excellent value for money.;0
1352;Disappointed;fast delivery. unfortunately the product is poor quality. compared to a mask of a different brand, always buy on amazon, always ffp2, this one has the thickness of a surgical mask. the weight and feel are completely different and the protection is certainly different. disappointed!;0
1353; damaged package, 4 masks missing; I understand that it is not up to you but I can't let you know in any other way. the package was placed inside an Amazon box that arrived open. it was too large and contained very heavy material so the mask packaging was crushed. Furthermore, someone opened it from underneath (the seal on the top was intact so we got involved and removed 4 masks.;0
1354; Size not suitable for adults; the masks are small, perhaps they can be functional for children, but they are not suitable for adults. I bought them after trying the pack of 20 pieces. which were perfect. I'm sorry but I won't buy them anymore. I asked for and received a 5-star refund from Amazon.;0
1355;Excellent product but...;the masks are very good but the elastics are really too short and hard and after a few minutes the ears hurt very badly. it would be appropriate to use longer and softer elastics. It's a shame because I find the product valid.;0
1356;Too big.....;the masks are larger than those purchased previously and the elastics are loose....I purchased them again because the first time they were perfect for both me and my wife (who he has a small face) but this time I have to say I'm very disappointed;0
1357; good product; good masks, quite comfortable, only flaw, some were just worn, the elastic immediately broke (this must have happened to 4-5 masks) for people whose faces are too big and therefore have to pull the elastic a little I don't recommend it a bit.;0
1358;BAD PRODUCT;poor quality product arrived on time but the masks are small, the elastics are too tight, it is almost impossible to wear them. some masks even have no elastic bands. highly recommended purchase. I also point out that Amazon does not let you return the product;0
1359;Very good but count the masks ;poor quality product arrived on time but the masks are small, the elastics are too tight, it is almost impossible to wear them. some masks even have no elastic bands. highly recommended purchase. I also point out that Amazon does not let you return the product;0
1360; Too tight; I always buy ffp2 masks here on Amazon, these seem to be the worst ones I've found so far. Compared to the others, they have a much lower thickness and what is unbearable, they have short elastic bands, so short that this morning after two hours I had to change the mask with a another model from another manufacturer which fortunately I had carried as a spare in my bag.failed;0
1361;Not satisfied;unfortunately, as in a previous purchase, the masks are not 50 but 49. I confirm what I have also read in other reviews, namely that the characteristics of the masks are affixed with two stamps of different sizes rather than being imprinted on them. This does not suit me makes you think well about the product.;0
1362; Satisfactory product even if it arrived in a broken box.; Unused box clearly opened and then closed badly with tape. fortunately the masks are closed individually. good elasticity (the elastic bands do not hurt at all behind the ears) and good portability.;0
1363; excellent but the elastic comes off almost immediately; excellent masks that are practically useless because the elastic always comes off immediately from the top right point. NB it could only be a problem with my batch but I go on with pins and when I don't have the stapler at hand have to be thrown away (and I'm in trouble);0
1364;I do not recommend purchasing;as many have written, the product is not optimal. the masks are very tight and not comfortable. furthermore, one yes and one no break on one side of the elastic probably because they are too small. I do not recommend purchasing;0
1365;Rubber bands are terrible. They are narrow. The underwire hurts! For children or very thin faces; be careful that they are too small. elastic bands that pull a lot on the ears. an adult can't wear them (tried by two boys aged 18 and 20 at nine and by two male and female adults with normal sized faces, it doesn't work for anyone!!!).;0
1366; incorrect description; the masks received are not suitable for adults. The straps that must be placed behind the ears are very short and an adult struggles to wear them, risking detaching the strap from the mask. The problem was reported and Amazon was superb in solving the problem.;0
1367;Unusable product incredibly short elastics. You can't sell a product like this; it's impossible to wear them, they have such a short elastic that not even a small child can wear them. what I don't understand is the lack of control. unfortunately it is the second time I have purchased this product and I have always been unable to use them;0
1368; Doubt about CE certification. Read...; this time I preferred to buy Italian. It's a shame that doubts about the certification persist given the period. compared to Chinese masks they are strangely very light. It has nine somewhat home-made stamps. I probably wouldn't buy them again;0
1369;Safe masks;excellent value for money for the moment they seem to be going very well! it is the first package of surgical masks that has individually packaged masks inside which is essential for hygiene! I recommend it;0
1370;I thought better...;problems with the elastic. out of 22 masks worn, 8 had the problem. elastics that came off already on the first day: some on the first try. the photo I am sending is the last and only one in the series to have been detached in that way. on the others the problem was on the seams of the mask.;0
1371;Not among the best;I bought this product several times with the hope that the first few times it was just a mistake but unfortunately I continue to find these masks in the box in addition to the ffp2 ones in the package. in the package there are approximately 40 ffp2 and two packages of these useless masks. for the rest they are good CE certified brand.;0
1372; Too bad they are all damaged; I have purchased this product several times, always with satisfaction. in this match, with the exception of 15 masks, in the others the ear elastics were detached. Sin! unreliable product;0
1373;They are not suitable for wearing by an adult;I find the ffp2 masks excellent but these proved to be the opposite. very difficult to wear for an hour with elastic bands that pull and it doesn't hurt much, let alone having to wear them for 8-10 hours at a time to work or school. it is almost impossible to wear them.;0
1374;The elastics give easily; terrible product. I'm really disappointed. I purchased a pack of 50 masks and on the second mask I use, the elastics did not give. The product is not suitable for return so I find myself with 48 useless masks. I strongly advise against the purchase;0
1375; Good product; masks arrived on time and well packaged individually. the fabric is breathable and the elastics are resistant. the only not exactly optimal aspect is that at the beginning they are not exactly odorless;0
1376;They do what they promise;the product itself deserves 3 stars. does what it promises. I give one star for the delivery which was horrible: whoever was the courier who delivered left the package in the entrance hall of the building without even ringing the bell.;0
1377; Quality but shipping more expensive than expected; I haven't opened the box but it will certainly be true as always. just one thing: I had to arrive at a collection point also to get free transport but I was still charged...;0
1378;Elastic bands are too short!;the masks are not good but the rubber bands are too short are not good enough for a child. I didn't return them precisely because I can make my 11 year old son wear them but for adults they are tight and it hurts a lot.;0
1379;Practical and comfortable;I bought these ffp2 masks for the excellent price and because they were recommended by Amazon. It has a flaw: the elastic detaches from the mask easily and you then have to make do to keep them on. they are practically disposable.;0
1380;Bad packaging;really poor packaging. I agree that it is a package of masks packaged in single envelopes but the package arrived in terrible conditions, completely damaged and with many single envelopes they are not in good condition. all crumpled. I ponder the return;0
1381; Very scarce;" ""the only positive side is that they don't stink, otherwise they are not valid. about half of the masks are cut badly so they open in half. in others the internal layer comes off. in short, very bad. it will be ninth also """"made in Italy"""" but they remain terrible.""";0
1382; TWO MASKS WERE MISSING; I purchased this product, nothing to say about the 100% made in Italy quality... moreover, made in my dear Calabria in Vibo Valentia... but in the package there were 2 fewer masks... 48 instead 50 as I had purchased...;0
1383;Good masks but the laces are TOO TIGHT;I have already ordered these masks 3 times and they are of good quality but the laces are really too tight and in the last batch I wore them even more! we use them on several people with different facial shapes and we have all encountered the same problem.;0
1384; the laces on the right are longer and less elastic than those on the left; I had purchased the pack of 30 for and was very happy with the portability and elasticity. I repurchased the product in the 50-piece format but the masks are larger and the d laces are longer and less elastic than those on the left;0
1385; Defective product; good morning, the safe protection masks are defective. When used they fray after a few hours. This is my first negative purchasing experience on Amazon. Kind regards Luigi Coniglio;0
1386;PROBLEM WITH THE ELASTICS;I purchased these masks for my children to be able to send them safely to school, unfortunately the elastics are too short, it is impossible to wear the mask for a few hours in a row for a child, let alone an adult!;0
1387; Tight; after many hours of use you can feel the discomfort caused by the elastic bands on the ears, perhaps a little tight. All in all satisfied with the product, well sealed and in good condition. Improved elasticity.;0
1388;The elastics break;"the elastics break immediately as if they were dry because they are ""old"". I will make a complaint. I have used some hoping to have accidentally found only a few defective ones but almost all of them break immediately.";0
1389;Disappointing last purchase;I have purchased these masks twice. the first time I was satisfied with an adequate mask with a good fit. the second time the packaging was slightly modified but the masks were no longer the same, shorter and more rigid elastic bands prevent a comfortable fit especially if you have to wear it for a few hours. very disappointed now I find myself with 50 masks that none of the family is able to wear comfortably because they are too tight. not recommended.;0
1390;Bad quality solos not recommended;bad, the worst I've ever tried! the bad luck was buying 50 and discovering that in my opinion they are not good. I use them for 8 hours a day, they don't allow me to breathe as well as other brands do. unfortunately I had to open them to try them and I couldn't return them but they were terrible, terrible! buy something else or if you want I'll give them to you;0
1391; the certifying body is not in the NANDO register; the certification leaves me with many doubts also because the certifying body is not in the Nando register. I bought them and decided not to use them given the dubious protection. Perhaps it would be better for Amazon to ascertain and guarantee better first to put protection products on sale in this period of pandemic. you play with people's health. why doesn't the Italian company that produces them have them certified by recognized bodies registered in nando?;0
1392;Bad product;very thin product with layers (only 4?) of inadequate fabric.one in every 3-4 breaks at the attachment of the mask holder after a few hours of use;0
1393;Not recommended, many are defective;"very bad.. on the writing ""the cat"" more than half have small holes in place of the final letter "" or"" due to excessive pressure of the stamp.. personally I was very impressed disappointed, I don't recommend them.";0
1394; Excellent quality to buy on promotion as they are a little expensive but you know you pay for a good product.; first of all the masks have nine four layers, the mask was carefully cut by the undersigned and checked. the filters are good at least as far as a mere mortal can understand, CE certified, made in Italy, not like many made in Italy that are not made in Italy. the product seems very good, the only flaw I would like to say is that the elastics are a little short but using those ear savers or those silicone rubbers solves the problem otherwise the ears after 8 hours of work suffer from the short elastic. I reordered this time for the colored ones. I would like to say that I really like the very large print highlighted on both sides, not like many masks that you can't even see and you don't understand who the seller is or where they are made. good, finally a good product.;0
1395; excellent and resistant; the package arrived on time without problems or problems. The masks were of the estimated number and of the type specified with the necessary certifications. Overall, resistant and reliable products. I found the elastic bands very tight, so much so that prolonged use could cause headaches for those with a particularly bulky head like mine. I therefore recommend paying attention to this possible problem;0
1396;I thought I was making an excellent purchase;I'll start by saying that the elastics are comfortable but the quality disappointed me. It feels like you're wearing cardboard. I didn't want to believe some reviews. but I have to tell myself that they were right. the first one I opened an elastic immediately came off. I hope the same thing doesn't happen to the others.;0
1397;Not satisfied. 4 Layers. Not 5.; it is made up of 4 layers. I have other ffp2 masks with 5 layers. honestly you can't understand anything anymore with these masks. in fact I bought other certified ffp2 masks with 5 layers. I will use these under the surgical mask;0
1398;Short elastics;poor product, the support elastics are extremely short and pull a lot on the ears, leaving marks. they are impossible to wear for more than an hour. Other family members have not encountered the same problems. not suitable for children.;0
1399; They work; they work perfectly, there are several in the package just as written in the description, convenient because they can be changed once filled with insects. the green rods where they should be inserted are a little uncomfortable because they don't hold up well and therefore it's a constant process of inserting them to hang them.;0
1400;After just one day it no longer works;I had to return the item because the headset stopped working after just one day. there is probably a contact. the fact is that only in some positions and by pulling/bending the wire can you hear it in both headphones. I would say that there is a lack of serious quality control on the parts put on the market by this Chinese company since unfortunately I am not the only one who has encountered problems. avoid wasting time (like I did) and look elsewhere;0
1401;It only worked for a little over a month;at the time of purchase I opted for a product that cost twice as much as other earphones offered for sale, hoping that it would be worth more. as long as it worked it honestly did its job but after just over a month one of the two headphones stopped working (I tested it on several smartphones with similar results) making it effectively useless. not advisable;0
1402; Poor packaging, broken case, good headphones; the headphones are as I expected, of course the material is plastic but they do their job. the packaging, however, leaves a lot to be desired because it was only packaged in a plastic bag and the case arrived undamaged. I don't do returns because I need patience. I didn't buy them for the case, I just had to say that it was quite disappointing, a little more careful packaging would have been enough. I hope the headphones last longer than the case.;0
1403; It broke after a few days; it arrived the next day, well packaged, everything was ok, even the sound was good and the noise was excluded. Except that after less than a week the audio quality dropped when the cable was moved, the earphones stopped playing the sound.sin;0
1404;Headphones with cancellation. noise reduction In-Ear Bass with Microphone and Controller (Black); they are old-fashioned headphones because the box shows the image of an audio cassette tape and not of an mp3 player. It seems silly but it's an important clue. However, the sound is sufficient and the bass can be heard sufficiently.;0
1405; Terrible product, I do not recommend it; product of very poor quality, none of its characteristics should reflect reality, very bad sound quality to avoid the non-existent noise and although the price is not excessive given the efficiency of the product, it is not worth the price Not even remotely worth it. I don't recommend it to anyone.;0
1406;Poor;I don't understand the positive reviews! sound quality is normal, the product presents itself aesthetically well but external sounds do not do anything at all and they also bother the ears a lot and are not comfortable at all. failed. It's not even worth 5 euros! There's too much cheap stuff on Amazon, you're terrible.;0
1407; Poor microphone quality; very standard sound, I don't notice anything particularly good. However, the microphone is very disappointing. in phone calls it feels like you are very far away - impossible to use in phone calls;0
1408;Wired headphones sometimes crackle;my daughters use Bluetooth headphones for music and wired ones for connecting with Teams for university lessons.unfortunately they often break with the wire, these are well made and feel great. the microphone can also be heard without excessive noise for the listener, let's see if they resist. My daughter tells me that they are starting to cause problems, I'm thinking of returning them. I wouldn't buy them again;0
1409;The electrostimulation of the product is good but the adhesives are really lacking; I practice a lot of physical activity and with this product I tried to give an extra boost to the definition of some parts of my body. in itself the stimulation seems good to me (even if the maximum intensity level of some functions is not at all unbearable, see abdomen). However, among the aspects that I believe to be lacking, I report that the two small electrostimulators often do not work well, as if they did not receive the signal to give the impulse correctly. Note of demerit also for the stickers: they last very little! I highly recommend that you immediately buy an additional set of stickers together with the product. I assure you that their shelf life is truly limited.;0
1410;It works;the product works without any problem. I would like to be able to contact the seller as 2 stickers are missing from the package received and this prevents me from using all 3 devices at the same time. furthermore, once applied the stickers cannot be removed without ruining them;0
1411;The price is fine.. but at least the honesty!;the price is very accessible so much so that you don't expect to have something in stainless steel for.. and that's exactly the case! at least let the truth be written! The tap looks good with all the accessories described.;0
1412; I must have been unlucky...; taken in May they seemed well sealed.... opened and inserted into the perp-4100 printer in August (I would add that there is no expiry date indicated in the cartridges). the black does not print... it seems dry the color inside. tried with head alignment / nozzle cleaning... nothing... 16 euros wasted;0
1413;COMPATIBLE;I was only able to test the product after a couple of months. So it is not possible to return but the black color is not recognized by the printer. In the end I had to buy another kit of compatible cartridges (hoping they work). after 1 month they sent me another kit of compatible cartridges, these work well so it was probably an unfortunate case.;0
1414;Disappointed; after the first print the printer blocks because it doesn't recognize the ink you have to turn it off and on again after each print. Bad purchase also because it's not that cheap. I took a middle ground because I thought they were better but nothing. ;0
1415;Fast shipping but...;the cartridges arrived earlier than the expected delivery day but the black ink cartridge had a broken plastic flap that allows it to be removed from the trolley. I can't comment on durability and quality yet as I've only printed a few sheets.;0
1416;Bad purchase;very bad I made two purchases two days apart because one was broken and now the printer doesn't even read magenta as well as yellow....what should be done in these cases they refund my money it's not two orders one;0
1417;Excellent;update: just a little while ago it started not printing anything anymore. the sheets come out white. it's incredible they can't only last a month. I've been using them for a month, nothing to report! it's fine, the prints are precise and the colors are right, the duration seems in line with the originals. I also updated the printer firmware and for now they continue to work correctly.;0
1418;It seems to work; the product seems valid and it doesn't bother me even though I have sensitive eyes but I only give 4 stars because I have the impression that it darkens the skin of my eyelids, it may be just my idea but I don't know if I will continue to use it.;0
1419;Excellent;excellent product I bought for my wife and she noticed from the second week that the eyelashes are thicker and more disciplined. I'm in my third month of using the same bottle and I confirm that the lashes are: 1. longer 2. thicker 3. more disciplined. when I put on mascara there is a real wow effect!! I have been asked several times if I had false eyelashes or if I had done lamination!;0
1420; Keeps its promises; I usually use eyelash and eyebrow serums and therefore I am always looking for new products and to find the one best suited to my characteristics. the package is 5 ml and the inside of the package is very elegant. it promises a strengthening effect and extra volume from the vegan formula. Looking at the ingredients list I can actually say that it is very good. I usually apply it in the evening both on the eyelashes and on the eyebrows and I actually noticed the difference between applying it or not as in 5 days of treatment the eyelashes are actually stronger and more voluminous. obviously like all things don't expect miracles I have a false eyelash effect but the difference is noticeable. on the growth speed factor I haven't noticed any effects but it still helps to strengthen. the only negative side if we want to call it that, it is the actually high price when there are other products with the same characteristics but with more accessible prices.;0
1421; beautiful and functional; beautiful and functional, unfortunately one of the two did not have a suction cup so I am forced to return and reorder the other two - update: 24/06 the replacement handles arrived - they adhere very well to smooth surfaces such as the tiles of the bathroom - excellent because they can be positioned as desired without having to drill the tiles and risk drilling a pipe inside the wall - we will see over time how they behave - Amazon service always at the top;0
1422; Suction cup shower handles; product chosen based on reviews! Despite having followed the steps indicated on the product page, neither of the two adhered to the bathroom tiles for more than 15/20 minutes. I don't know if this only happens to me........I have strong doubts not. forget it.roberto;0
1423;Strange effects! I would like to be reassured that it is not harmful; I put a collar on one of my 3 cats... reaction: he started running all over the house, he seemed to be under the influence of some acid. removed it immediately, perhaps he was bothered by the smell or by having something on his neck... the second cat has been wearing it for a week but seems drugged... he always sleeps and has calmed down a lot... I don't know if it's normal.....anyway the smell is very good but it's noticeable I hope it doesn't bother the cat...I have no idea if it works as a pesticide...I'll have to put drops on the other 2 because they can't keep it. we'll see;0
1424; Harmful for the cat; I purchased it for the value for money which seemed excellent. After a week the cat started scratching and losing its hair and the area under the collar was filled with scabs. removed immediately.;0
1425;It is ineffective;after only two weeks I found two fleas right on my neck behind the collar! with this I think I have said everything because needless to say that the perfume was pleasant, well packaged etc. but if it doesn't work it was money wasted!;0
1426; EXCELLENT BUT DIFFICULT TO KNOW IF IT REALLY WORKS; excellent collar at a bargain price for complete protection of the animal, very simple to cut the collar to adjust it and very simple to place on the animal. I certainly have no way of scientifically proving whether the collar really works but every now and then when I look at the cat I don't detect fleas or other small animals so I would say that 1 month later the collar is doing its excellent job.;0
1427; Attracts fleas; the product is well packaged and arrived very quickly. all in all it is well done. the problem is that it doesn't do its job. I had the impression that it was a flea attractant!! my cat always stays at home and has never had any parasites... when he put this collar on he filled up with fleas. disappointed.;0
1428;Not long lasting;the collar is good but doesn't last long after just a month there are fleas right on the neck where the collar is..satisfied but not too much. in the description it says 8 months but it only lasted a month;0
1429;I advise against it.;I strongly advise against it. it had no effect at all, the fleas were there and have remained there, multiplying enormously!! Furthermore, both cats lost their hair near the collar. I'm giving one star because I can't help but give it.;0
1430; ineffective against ticks; the product looks good but was useless against ticks. I even found 4 of them right under the collar after wearing it for a week. The only mitigating factor is that it is a stray cat that has now settled in the area. none of my company.;0
1431;Not even.;beautiful to look at and light. very light. it goes on micro for two minutes. the problem is that the decoration is not a print on plastic but a single paper sticker like the ones on bean cans so to speak and therefore already at the first wash I had to take great care not to ruin it all.;0
1432;Ok;the mug is really cute. the design is well done but the problem is that it gets ruined quickly. after just 1 day it was already scratched (I'm referring to the design). I saw the photos of the other reviews and it's the same defect as my mug. I still give three stars because it does its job. my child drinks from it very well so I don't regret the purchase especially considering that the expense is low.;0
1433; Quality/price ok; mug arrived on time super fast as always. Very nice image of Mickey Mouse attached well for now but it doesn't give the impression that it will last very long. For the price I paid I didn't expect excellent quality, in fact that's the case. but for what I need to use it, it's more than fine. However, it is worth the money spent. Be careful, it does not seem suitable for washing in the dishwasher. microwave holds well.;0
1434;Display mug;I didn't even want to waste time commenting on this article which in my opinion for 5 is very expensive. When the package arrived I thought it was empty as the cardboard was heavier. I don't recommend it and I wouldn't buy it again. maybe I leave it just for display because the kid likes to see hulk.;0
1435;A real rip-off;I thought the cup would be better, a real disappointment. I took the cup and glued it with adhesive which after two or three washes, even the color comes out completely. and costs around 6 euros. you could pay 2 euros for a plastic cup, I was really disappointed by the image, it looks better.;0
1436;You can be better;the mug is nice and the price is right. Unfortunately it arrived a little damaged with some missing color pieces. I honestly don't think the cover will last long since it's made of paper, let's hope for the best..;0
1437; Unsatisfactory; it is not the product I expected. It is a very light plastic cup with a card stuck around it with a print that from the images you can see is not perfect as it has white specks. I asked to return the product. It also seems impossible to me that it won't be ruined after the first wash. I don't recommend the purchase. It costs six euros but it's not worth it as a drinking cup.... perhaps as a pencil holder but given its lightness, perhaps not even for that.;0
1438;Disney Mickey Mouse mug; it is comfortable and practical, very large but the quality of the plastic is not the best after just one day of use without putting it in the microwave or dishwasher the color comes off and I honestly don't like it!;0
1439;It looks like a toy;cup?? why don't they call it what it really is which is a cheap plastic cup!!! certainly with the price I couldn't expect much but at least a little more resistant a disappointment.. the only thing that can console me is that it is suitable for the microwave!;0
1440;Completely disappointed with the item; it is not possible that the item arrived today and after the first wash it looks like this. gently washed by hand. I bought similar products and these results were visible but after months of use/washing.;0
1441;Unsafe product!;Apparently good quality lightweight plastic material with a handle for easy grip even for small children who need to learn how to hold a cup. however, during the second wash I preferred to throw it away and it was not necessary to put it in the dishwasher. in the photo you can in fact see the marks left by my baby's teeth (15 months): the decoration is easily damaged and loses its colour!! it is not a safe product!;0
1442;The graphic part is a caution sticker.;It's nice, children like it. unfortunately the graphics are only adhesive and glued. so after a few washes it fades and starts to come apart... of course you can use it anyway but it's a common red plastic cup. and that is worth 50 cents.;0
1443;TO AVOID!;the cup is very small, the materials are not of high quality and are evident from the noni on the cup. It also gives off a very unpleasant smell even after washing it. Another negative aspect is the lack of a box, in fact the cup arrives there inside the Amazon box and covering it there is only a simple plastic bag. the only positive aspect is the price which is very low but this does not justify the cup. furthermore the package arrived early.;0
1444;Not even.;beautiful to look at and light. very light. it goes on micro for two minutes. the problem is that the decoration is not a print on plastic but a single paper sticker like the ones on bean cans so to speak and therefore already at the first wash I had to take great care not to ruin it all.;0

I don't recommend it and I wouldn't buy it again. maybe I leave it just for display because the kid likes to see hulk.;0
1448;You can be better;beautiful children's mug. very light and above all unbreakable otherwise we would have to buy one a day! clear and durable design printing. I've already washed it several times in the dishwasher and it's still perfect. recommended item;0
1449;Unsatisfactory;I got the mug as a gift for a child who is passionate about superheroes and he was very happy. it is light and easy to handle. as written in previous posts, be careful to wash in the dishwasher, better by hand to avoid ruining the sticker.;0
1450;Disney Mickey Mouse mug; it is comfortable and practical, very large but the quality of the plastic is not the best after just one day of use without putting it in the microwave or dishwasher the color comes off and I honestly don't like it!;0

1456;Very functional;this small accessory will revolutionize your sink. with a small expense you can opt not to buy very expensive latest generation mixers because this accessory has many water jet functions! For now I feel great and I don't know how I managed without it! The extension supplied is excellent for moving the DJ water jet! top;0
1457; there are adapters for the various threads which is very useful;" ""I have been using this product for a month and I am finding it really good. Aesthetically it is very nice but the ""shower"" functionality is very convenient. It is easy to assemble and I had a great time straight away. It's very practical and sturdy. Highly recommended""";0
1458; Functional; bought for my son to use at school. right size, not bulky to be slipped into the backpack among the books. Cap closes well, no drops of water come out. water bottle entirely made of plastic.;0
1459;Consistency;my twins immediately liked them..practical and convenient..the design is printed directly on the bottle so there is no risk of it coming off over time..and above all they don't smell like plastic..we are satisfied;0
1460; Poor quality; beautiful. comfortable colored practice. only flaw: if there was a closing spout it would be the best. my daughter takes it to nursery and they keep it on the desk and I didn't have a closing spout it is unhygienic.;0
1461; it is not what was ordered;" ""as per the title, I ordered a 400ml water bottle, but instead I received a smaller one with a Minecraft lunch box, I imagine as a kind of """"compensation""."" poor plastic and unfairness of the seller. not recommended. delivery as always flawless thanks to Amazon.""";0
1462;Durable plastic;the image of spiderman is printed in the plastic so it is easy to wash without it being ruined. I didn't find it comfortable. The spout has little opening so it is a little awkward to drink. To be safe, I didn't put it in the dishwasher.;0
1463;Good but not great;arrived in the wrong color, ordered skin color but arrived pink, I didn't return it because I needed it immediately. the size corresponds perfectly. in itself it does its job and is cute but unfortunately after just a few uses the elastic under the part that you pull down to breastfeed has frayed.;0
1464; Flavored water; I have tried multiple brands of products that are supposed to help diuresis and therefore deflate/ drain/ improve liver function. This does nothing! It adds a new taste to the liter of water to which it should be added and stop. Expensive product and in my opinion invalid;0
1465; Average rating; ok easy to put on a little hard to cut but very long so it's good for different breeds. However, the ones in one box were folded backwards and I struggled to get them to take the right shape. As far as protection is concerned, it's ok for now;0
1466; Excellent value for money; I was looking for a natural product and it seems I found it. It's a little early to evaluate the real effectiveness but for the moment it seems like an excellent product. we go out for a walk every day and I haven't seen any parasites. dogs tolerate it well, it has no unpleasant odors and is well made. suitable for any size. I am satisfied. the price is excellent and it is a good product;0
1467;RIFT;I received the old model and not the new one as specified in the announcement. therefore it is certainly an old obsolete product given that after not even 2 days on my dog's neck it completely lost its smell let alone its effectiveness in fact my dog continues to scratch nothing but protection for 8 months :( money wasted it is not a product in the slightest reliable at least not the one I received.;0
1468;Nothing much!;the collars are very long and adaptable, the real problem lies in their effectiveness at least in a short time. For now my dogs which had a few fleas being outside after having put them on have decreased but not disappeared completely.Maybe in a Then it will disappear too, let's hope for the best.;0
1469;Bad collar;bad collar not only did it not eradicate fleas, not only did it have a strong and nauseating odor but the most serious thing was that my dog continued to scratch. The result gave him a bad allergy. money wasted;0
1470;Surprise;excellent quality/price ratio. you can adjust the size and eliminate the excess easily. I've been using it for a month and it still gives off its scent which is absolutely not annoying like others used in the past. the thing my daughter likes most is that it glows in the dark.;0
1471;Disgusting collar;really disgusting collar cheap chinoiserie!! two different dogs made me vomit and feel sick, both of them since I put the collar on, they didn't poop and vomit all over the house until I took it off!! I didn't buy it;0
1472; Product does not conform to the description; the item arrives in excellent packaging in a metal box. it has a pleasant lemon smell which has already been removed in 4 days, it has no repressive effect against parasites etc. mine should be bright but it isn't. it is very robust and has loops to adapt it to various breeds. not recommended as a parasite protection product.;0
1473; Almost perfect; arrived on time. sturdy with bright colors, each daily compartment is contained in a nice sturdy box that allows you to move it comfortably but also to open it and remove the daily container to be able to carry it in your pocket when needed. the openings of each compartment are well fixed so it is difficult for them to open inadvertently. I don't give 5 stars because in my opinion it has only one flaw and that is that it lacks the midday compartment which my father who uses it would need.;0
1474; Functional and practical.; It is convenient because it has different colors for each day of the week. The compartments open easily. It's a shame that there is no compartment: lunch which is what I would have needed for my parents so that the lunch cp I have to put them in the compartment: afternoon. Apart from this small flaw I find it very useful.;0
1475; Functional; can be used as a unit (at home) or separately for the days (if you travel). Got this for my elderly father who has trouble remembering if he takes his various pills. is helping him keep the administration under control.useful.;0
1476;One of the few weekly pillboxes with lid in Italian;it is now difficult to find weekly pillboxes that are not broken down for each day;0
1477;Returned;the item was really nice and well thought out but the compartments are too small obviously talking about pills with cut out blister. for hygienic reasons I prefer to use it with packaged pills therefore the article is unsuitable.;0
1478;Very bad.;update at the beginning it seemed like a nice product but after a few weeks of use the doors are very soft and fragile and the color of the writing is coming off and there is always the fear that they will suddenly come off.;0
1479; Pill box; purchased to replace a similar one with three daily compartments. I found this pill box not very spacious, the 4 compartments are not large enough for the service I requested. I made the return.;0
1480; Damaged; unfortunately the item arrived unused as you can see from the photo, the closure is broken. It's trivial but it was sent knowing that it was to be ignored. little professionalism. I kept it because I needed it immediately.;0
1481;Grossolano;coarse workmanship made with an abundance of material (probably two could be made with the same material). the result is a heavy compass that has to be adjusted with force making it difficult to use. I wouldn't buy it again.;0
1482; Good product; I was happy with it. I had to place several thick threads (not heavy!) on different types of surfaces and so far it's not holding up well. I don't know if when I have to remove them from the wall the plaster will also come off. the important thing for now is that they do their job as cable holders;0
1483;Robust;"Even if I use it for DIY jobs you can see that it is a professional tool in all respects. Powerful, solid and robust. Possibility of changing the position of the sleeve making it very convenient to work in ""awkward"" positions. .also equipped with a bag with internal pockets so you can place all your accessories. in short, fully satisfied";0
1484;Robust;"even if I use it for DIY jobs you can see that it is a professional tool in all respects. powerful, solid and robust. possibility of changing the position of the sleeve thus making it very convenient to work in ""awkward"" positions .also equipped with a bag with internal pockets so you can place all your accessories. in short, fully satisfied";0
1485; fair+; despite all the precautions the lower left corner has some air cracks but it is not something that compromises the aesthetics and at the beginning it resisted fingerprints in a commendable manner unlike the pre-glued film on the tablet and then instead it gave in and filled up with fingerprints, certainly by cleaning it with a damp cloth with some glasses spray it regains clarity, however it is not as oleophobic as I would have liked it, it will certainly depend on the hand that uses it. as protection I think it is optimal, the thickness promises well, applying it is easy if you follow the instructions in Italian printed in the box that was delivered to me intact and with all the seals.;0
1486;Ineffective;I started using it on September 1st. I take a pill at the end of a meal. it causes me painful cramps every time for at least 3 hours and a feeling of bloating. after another 3 or 4 hours a mild laxative action occurs and everything ends there. the cost is certainly too high. over-the-counter laxatives certainly cost much less. I won't buy it again.;0
1487;DON'T BUY IT JUST WASTE THE MONEY;I waited to finish the whole jar to review these phantom fat burning pills....the result is that not only have I not lost a gram but I have even gained slightly weight;0
1488;Useless;in my life I have tried several supplements, convinced by the reviews I decided to try this one.unfortunately at least for me it doesn't give any benefit whatsoever therefore it is absolutely not recommended.;0
1489; Nothing special; I waited a month to see the effects but I must say that in my case I seemed to feel more benefits at the beginning (perhaps due to the placebo effect). It certainly gives a little more energy but I don't know if it I would buy again.;0
1490; Fake Tiredness; I took the supplement for a few days as an energy boost which you then pay for by not being able to recover well especially if you are an agitated person and the effect ends up not allowing you to catch your breath even when there is no need to stay alert. attention;0
1491;It doesn't work for me, it doesn't vibrate, it just turns on the light, well, I don't recommend it; the materials it's made of seem very good to me, it does the job. obviously you can't do a deep cleansing of your face... but I can really feel the difference in my skin since I've been using it. so I definitely recommend it!;0
1492; Scratches, cracks and stains; the glass packaging of the product has a significant crack on the side which, if it were not for the fact that it was supposed to be a Christmas present, could have been fine but the product inside was scratched and stained both on the front and on the back. back.;0
1493;Compact and functional.;Excellent product. the adapter is quite compact (as far as possible having to transform a USB A into USB C). It works and doesn't cost a lot considering that there are two in the package. Tested on iPad Pro 2021 with external HDD. Edit: unfortunately one of the two has stopped working.;0
1494; It DOES NOT work with Electronic Identity Cards - Support DOES NOT respond; the aesthetics are good but it is not true that it works with electronic identity cards - support does not respond, Amazon must not allow providing untrue information on the products offered for sale. However, if it were true that this product that we returned because it didn't work actually reads electronic identification cards. and that it was only a problem with the one purchased we would like to know because if necessary we are willing to buy it again! technology journalists association;0
1495;Useful;I would have given 5 stars if it didn't have the problem that sometimes it doesn't read the cards but it's probably just mine anyway, just take them out and back in and everything will be fine. It's streamlined my work a lot.;0
1496; Good; good reader and it works with no small flaws that I would improve is the fact that the red LED always stays on and does not change when the card is inserted so there is no visual indication of card reading;0
1497;Still to be fully evaluated;"in the meantime, get one thing out of your head: if you have erectile deficits this is of no use to you. probably if you are under pressure for work or problems eat you up and consequently everything is reflected in the deepest layers of male psyche (let me be clear because this is not a product for the female libido) certainly the greater strength it gives you in terms of head effort can be of help. in terms of efficiency at work I have benefited greatly from it. for the I'm staying ""as before more than before"".so tadalafil and off we go otherwise your friend never gets up from there again I'm sorry but what needs to be said must be said!!!";0
1498;To be improved in terms of aesthetics, materials and PRICE!;It does its job for goodness sake but aesthetically we are not there. The airtag fits well but it's the design and the plasticky object that doesn't satisfy me. the piece of plastic is absolutely not worth the price paid.;0
1499; Good value for money; I bought it to put it in my wallet. a little big but still fits. It's the cheapest option I've found and so it also seems right to me. I won't move it often so it's something I only need to avoid leaving the lairtag with nothing and risk getting scratched among the coins but I would never use it as a keychain because it doesn't seem so secure to me and it can get scratched if you move it often .;0
1500;Plammaxs Microneedle Derma Roller;initially I was skeptical to be honest but due to some skin imperfections I still wanted to try. At the first use obviously you don't see the benefits immediately but after about ten days I can say I'm surprised to see my skin regenerate! so I recommend purchasing!;0
1501; Effective on pain and mood; I had the opportunity to see the effects of pea with an 18-year-old cat who no longer walked due to pain. within a week he started walking and lifting his tail again. I then looked for a human product containing pea since I suffer from chronic pain and purchased this product. after 3 days I have already seen the results. it must be taken every day. the powder creates a pasty lump in the mouth so I recommend filling the mouth with a little water and pouring the sachet to swallow immediately after everything together.;0
1502;To check...;I've been taking them for a few days for tendinitis but for now they have 0 effects. The sachets will not be buccal soluble (preferably CPRS) but the flavor isn't the best and creates a mess in the mouth. Better to dose them and then throw down a some water and I recommend eating a full stomach. I will update the review if I see improvements...;0
1503; fun training, only noisy flaw; I bought this tool on the advice of a friend who has been using it for a while. easy to assemble, easy to use. the plastic circle is made up of small sections fixed to each other thanks to a button that hooks them together like rails. a small stopwatch runs outside the circle (only stopwatch with on/off function stop and reset) to which the weight is attached with a small (adjustable) rope. The training consists of rotating the weight as for the classic hoola hoop. I am using it 3/4 times a week with times that vary from 20 to 35/40 min. I find it fun and I believe that it is an excellent workout for oblique abdominals, the waistline and to see tangible results afterward I imagine it will take at least a month of constant daily use. I tried using it at various oscillation speeds in an upright position in a half squat position and Peace of mind. The only flaw (also reported by other users): the noise. it's all made of plastic so the noise it produces is actually a bit annoying, not so much for those who practice it (obviously with earphones and music) but if you do it at home or outdoors, like in a nearby garden, sensitive people could make you notice that you're making noise.;0
1504;Good even if noisy; I've been using it for half an hour a day for a week and I must say that the results are slowly visible! among other things, it adapts to every body type, in fact at the beginning I was worried because I have a 65 cm waist and I thought I wouldn't be able to use it but instead thanks to the removable segments I managed to find my size! I highly recommend it, it's a fun workout and can be used anywhere, even in the bedroom!;0
1505;Not completely satisfied;I was always a failure as a child with the hula hoop and with this one I finally redeemed myself!being able to customize the circumference as desired with many easily detachable segments, all you need to do is add the piece that slides inside the tool way to then rotate the weight around the waist. used with music at a fast pace it becomes an easy and fun workout after half an hour spent well. the work on the abdominals is felt at the end of the session we will see the results later.;0
1506;But.........;a one-of-a-kind tool! you can train and have fun at the same time, easy to assemble for all sizes, just add or remove the pieces. it is very resistant and the ball is heavy and helps training a lot. then the pink color is beautiful!!!;0
1507;Does its job;I was looking for something to entertain my daughter at the same time to get her moving a bit after this lockdown I must admit that it is very fun to do. it is very easy to assemble there are various sizes;0
1508; interesting idea but it has some flaws...; it is a tool capable of training more or less effectively the muscles of the lower abdomen, the same ones that we would have trained with a classic hula hoop. in the package there are: -elements of the Modular hula hoop (16) - 300g weight with rope and block with stopwatch to be inserted into the structure. - Instructions Once everything is assembled with a maximum circumference of 124cm we can insert the element that rotates inside the structure and then close the The opening is positioned around the waist. Each element has a sort of plastic bearing that oscillates, effectively cushioning shocks. The chronometer is a bit basic, there is no calorie counter and an automatic stop when we stop so it's a very normal chronometer nothing sensational. However, the rotating element runs perfectly even if the noise is not negligible, in fact I recommend it only when you are sure you won't bother anyone nearby (or not). The price of around 55 is not in line with the value of the product in my opinion it should cost at least 10% less to have an adequate quality-price ratio but beyond this I can say that the product works well for this reason I still feel like recommending it.;0
1509;In my opinion it is also a bit dangerous ...;I received this article thanks to the vine reviewer program. It's quite heavy, definitely heavier than a normal hula hoop so you need to get used to it. It's a bit noisy, nothing unbearable, of course, but if there is someone in the same room who is resting or even watching TV, they will certainly find it annoying. The thing that left me most perplexed, however, concerns safety. the ball weighs approximately 300 g and when the hula hoop is used it must be tensioned and rotate. I can't imagine what it would do if it were to inadvertently come off...judging by the amount of positive reviews it's probably my problem but I honestly don't feel like recommending it.;0
1510;Slimming hula hoop, good idea but to be reviewed; I had seen this particular hula hoop on social media for some time and was intrigued by it. basically for those like me who have never managed to use the classic hula hoop this product could be an idea not only to have fun but to lose weight and strengthen the abdominal muscles using it. It arrives home in a cardboard package completely disassembled but the assembly is rather simple and is based on pins that must fit into each other. this system also allows us to adjust the width according to our needs. once assembled I tried it and I can say that first of all it is not that simple to continue rotating the ball with the weight which must remain in order to function as a slimming exercise pears not raised in mid-air. another thing: in order to be useful for losing weight and strengthening the abdominal muscles you have to use it for at least 30 minutes at a time but this is rather difficult as you get tired easily much sooner. I found the the presence of a display that takes into account the laps done and the activity time I believe it is very useful for the slimming purpose of the product. Personally I have used it a few times also because the massage pins that rest on the skin after a short time of use the I found it annoying and almost painful. At the time of the review this product is sold for around 53 euros to which we can apply a 5 euro discount coupon for a final price of around 48 euros, a price which I still find excessive considering the various improvements that can be made to the product. ;0
1511; Functional and working plastic wheels and a slightly high price; delivered promptly by Amazon in cardboard packaging. The packaging consists of a black cardboard box in which the item is stored disassembled, protected by a thin layer of sponge and with a information sheet (in English). It is a traditional tool for losing weight or trimming the waistline. It is probably more suitable for women than for men but I bought it to use it myself because the principle convinces me. of operation, that is, the rotation of a counterweight tied to this adjustable belt which exerts pressure on the blocks placed in opposite positions. It makes reasonable sense for it to work. The problem is being able to make it rotate. I almost succeed, then after a while I get excited and I have to start again, but my wife can do it for as long as she wants (which she also envies because between the two of us I'm the one who needs to reduce her belly). The material seems good, a pleasant and sturdy plastic, 18 sections that can be easily assembled and disassembled to obtain the necessary diameter from small to xxxlarge I can guarantee that as I am xxl I have not put all the available sections of these there is one with a release button the same as all the others but red I cannot indicate why it is of a different color there is a nice heavy counterweight equipped with a small digital instrument, perhaps a clock or a counter, I haven't even turned it on, connected with a ribbon to a rail (with plastic wheels which will cause it to lose a star) which must be inserted into the hidden track of the hula-hop. in conclusion it is a good product, shame about the plastic rail, the price of around 53 seems reasonable to me but also a little high. I thank the Amazon vine program which offered me to try and use this nice tool already nonico. I hope I have been of help the tool is functional and it works, I can make it turn and therefore do exercises with it in the morning the thing I really don't like are the plastic wheels on the track, it will be the weak point especially because I've seen that others use steel ones which is sad and that I can make this one work better than the others but it certainly won't be thanks to the wheels. If I've been helpful I thank you. Update: at a certain point I told myself I had to succeed I too am doing nonastics every day. On the first day I managed to do 5 minutes. Nowadays even 30. I sit in front of the TV and do this rotation with the tool clockwise and anti-clockwise. I have to confess that I can do the clockwise one for 15 continuous minutes. the other one much less and I have to shoot from a standstill several times, however in light of this I would say that as a gymnastic tool it is valid for both males and females, pay attention to the volume of the TV, the rotation is noisy and you risk turning it up too much to listen the programs.;0
1512;Interesting idea;hula hoop is a fun way to get in shape and tone your body. I am unable to use the traditional one and this makes me lose the desire to continue training. This smart hula hoop has solved my problem because it never falls. The kit includes 18 rings that can be connected to each other using the button located on the one side of each piece. based on the waist circumference we evaluate how many pieces you fit together. to make it go just insert the piece with the display into the track of the formed circle and slide the gravitational ball towards one direction and the ball will continue its path by inertia. given that hula hoop it is well connected to the waist unlike the traditional ones we have free hands so it is also possible to play on the mobile phone while training. inside each ring there is a vibrating massage point which is in full contact with the muscles with which it is possible carry out a 360 degree waist massage. on the display we have an on/off on/stop button to start and stop the time count and the reset button. I would have preferred to have the lap count. With the price of 47 69 it seems a little high for the quality. while exercising with this hula hoop it produces a rather loud noise.;0
1513; NOT SUITABLE FOR MEN; I tried this product as it was on offer at a low price but during its short use I did not find any benefits. However, I stopped using it almost immediately because the weight during the end of the rotation or when it is lost can easily hit the lower parts, becoming dangerous.;0
1514;It works but..;it managed to stand up to the evil pigeons that are raging on my balcony. the percentage of guano per cm2 has greatly decreased. the only flaw is that on non-sunny days having only solar charging it turns off.. it wouldn't have been bad to also have the possibility of wired charging.. but anyway I recommend it.. being careful to expose it to the sun as much as possible..;0
1515; It doesn't resist bad weather; after two weeks the buzzer is crackling outside and it's annoying to hear. I won't send it back so as not to go through the whole process of returning it but I won't buy any more. Let's at least hope that the other two will last the month.;0
1516;USEELESS;I started out very confident given the positive reviews but I have to change my mind because the cats calmly walk past us! I didn't solve the problem! the bollards also have a very annoying flaw... on sunny days they are barely reached by its rays or every 20 seconds! the video is proof of this, money down the drain!;0
1517;Bad glue; I bought these sheets to be able to make stickers with the plotter which is impossible but the glue on the sheets has no hold and makes it impossible to complete a job. I purchased another brand and the result was excellent.;0
1518; It's not worth the price; it's practically impossible to use it with a cutting plotter. It detaches immediately from the base and remains attached to the transfer film. With difficulty I attached it to the Christmas bauble..... we'll see how long it lasts. Terrible value for money;0
1519; Avengers umbrella for children; the item is as described in the photo, beautiful design, fast shipping, easy to open and close. only flaw: the age or at least the height of the child who can use it was not indicated since my son is 6 to 9 but moreover almost 130 cm for him it is already almost a little small.;0
1520;Not even.;beautiful to look at and light. very light. it goes on micro for two minutes. the problem is that the decoration is not a print on plastic but a single paper sticker like the ones on bean cans so to speak and therefore already at the first wash I had to take great care not to ruin it all.;0
1521;Okay;the mug is really cute. the design is well done but the problem is that it gets ruined quickly. after just 1 day it was already scratched (I'm referring to the design). I saw the photos of the other reviews and it's the same defect as my mug. I still give three stars because it does its job. my child drinks from it very well so I don't regret the purchase especially considering that the expense is low.;0
1522; Quality/price ok; mug arrived on time super fast as always. Very nice image of Mickey Mouse attached well for now but it doesn't give the impression that it will last very long. For the price I paid I didn't expect excellent quality, in fact that's the case. but for what I need to use it, it's more than fine. However, it is worth the money spent. Be careful, it does not seem suitable for washing in the dishwasher. microwave holds well.;0
1523;Display mug;I didn't even want to waste time commenting on this article which in my opinion for 5 is very expensive. When the package arrived I thought it was empty as the cardboard was heavier. I don't recommend it and I wouldn't buy it again. maybe I leave it just for display because the kid likes to see hulk.;0
1524;You can be better;beautiful children's mug. very light and above all unbreakable otherwise we would have to buy one a day! clear and durable design printing. I've already washed it several times in the dishwasher and it's still perfect. recommended item;0
1525;Unsatisfactory;I got the mug as a gift for a child who is passionate about superheroes and he was very happy. it is light and easy to handle. as written in previous posts, be careful to wash in the dishwasher, better by hand to avoid ruining the sticker.;0
1526;Disney Mickey Mouse mug; it is comfortable and practical, very large but the quality of the plastic is not the best after just one day of use without putting it in the microwave or dishwasher the color comes off and I honestly don't like it!;0
1527;It looks like a toy;cup?? why don't they call it what it really is which is a cheap plastic cup!!! certainly with the price I couldn't expect much but at least a little more resistant a disappointment.. the only thing that can console me is that it is suitable for the microwave!;0
1528;Completely disappointed with the item; it is not possible that the item arrived today and after the first wash it looks like this. gently washed by hand. I bought similar products and these results were visible but after months of use/washing.;0
1529;Unsafe product!;Apparently good quality lightweight plastic material with a handle for easy grip even for small children who need to learn how to hold a cup. however, during the second wash I preferred to throw it away and it was not necessary to put it in the dishwasher. in the photo you can in fact see the marks left by my baby's teeth (15 months): the decoration is easily damaged and loses its colour!! it is not a safe product!;0
1530;The graphic part is a sticker.;It's nice, children like it. unfortunately the graphics are only adhesive and glued. so after a few washes it fades and starts to come apart... of course you can use it anyway but it's a common red plastic cup. and that is worth 50 cents.;0
1531;TO AVOID!;the cup is very small, the materials are not of high quality and are evident from the noni on the cup. It also gives off a very unpleasant smell even after washing it. Another negative aspect is the lack of a box, in fact the cup arrives there inside the Amazon box and covering it there is only a simple plastic bag. the only positive aspect is the price which is very low but this does not justify the cup. furthermore the package arrived early.;0
1532;Great rubbish;unfortunately I let myself be convinced by some positive reviews but I have to say that whoever gave one star is right it's a rip off. It barely works for 2 minutes then it stopped working I changed the batteries but nothing. I don't recommend the purchase vibrates slightly and the light is so weak that I don't think it has the declared effect. in short, a big piece of crap. better to opt for something more serious. the only positive aspect is the ultra-fast delivery with Amazon.;0
1533;First impression? 2 stars but I would like to change my mind.; I received the massager the same day and the first application was not very exciting: 1) first of all I was disappointed with the materials: both the body and the metallic ends are entirely made of plastic. 2) the the cone end does not vibrate.3) the vibration starts with any contact with the device there is no power button which makes it necessary to remove the batteries each time it is used.4) the batteries must be inserted by unscrewing the upper part cone which (at least in my product) does not close firmly but tends to open continuously during use. I purchased the product taking advantage of the 50% discount and therefore at just over 12 euros but this does not justify the possibility that it is the usual movie totally useless since I would have paid much more than the full price to have a good product. I will update the review (and possible evaluation) regarding the results in a few weeks.;0
1534;Returned!;Rendered! the headphone jack doesn't work. Furthermore, but above all, it doesn't work with the cover because it doesn't fit completely. Peccatops, I have to give it a star because I would take away at least 3.0;0
1535;Not good for magsafe!;premise: my airpods pro are in the version with magsafe charging so without this cover I can still attach them and charge them with the appropriate original Apple charger. the product is nice and well made for the price. The improper use of magnets to park it on the refrigerator or other metal surfaces is nice. As for charging with Magsafe, it sticks to it as expected but often the case is not recharged. It happened to me several times that I left it warm for several hours but found it still empty.;0
1536; Complicated, I personally didn't like it; too complicated, it's not at all easy to apply and position the gel disks once placed on the yong ge. too few seconds to position it after you've chosen the program. It takes a rear mirror to set it up and start it.;0
1537;Bad product;my sister bought this product and it is broken. I advise you not to buy it. this product is not only expensive but also ineffective. the key is to make him lose power and cause physical damage.;0
1538; Arrived in a different shaped model; apart from the fact that I received another item I can say that it works well and is well made. I don't exchange it because I had already returned it with another product of a different brand and I don't want to wait any longer. it recharges with a USB cable and not with a battery, at least this model which unfortunately is less effective given that it does not work on the upper horizontal band which is absent for this model. The programs are good and the impulses feel strong already at 4 power. the material is good and resistant also the stickers stick very well to the skin. the only flaw is that it doesn't have a remote control and therefore it becomes inconvenient to change intensity or program on your own. I succeeded in front of the mirror or while lying down once I got used to it.;0
1539; Compatible, it almost seems like the one from the parent company; I purchased this cover for the price given that the original one has a crazy price. It looks good and covers the phone well in all its parts including the camera which is more protruding than previous models. I hope it's also really anti-yellowing but for the price I can also buy another one in a few months. recommended;0
1540;It seems like a good product but...;unfortunately the cover does not remain adherent in the upper part and is not straight and is not in line in the upper part, you can clearly see that it remains crooked which makes the whole phone look ugly. in the end it may be fine as a cheap cover but having switched to the original Apple cover which fits perfectly is a completely different story.;0
1541;BAD! Avoid it like the plague!!!; not only was there only 1 film in the box instead of 2 but moreover the only one had a huge bubble near the face ID area. terrible experience, avoid buying this poor product!;0
1542; Bubbles on both films; unfortunately, despite having done everything well, some bubbles formed, I didn't try to put the other one on because I think it's the same, plus for the iPhone 13 Pro it's slightly smaller. update after having reviewed the product with 2 stars I'm I was pleasantly contacted by the manufacturing company for support with the sending of another product or the refund without return. I chose the refund which I received in a few days and therefore for this reason I also decided to try the second film but unfortunately, as I thought, this one also presents one bubble the first one had two I give 4 stars for the attention to the customer but the product in some cases like mine already has small bubbles;0
1543; Good cover; nice cover with high protection on the edges. the only flaw is that the opening for the cameras does not protect lens by lens but leaves open a window that is nice to look at but less protective while still protecting the lenses by placing the phone upside down;0
1544; It is not transparent; I purchased this cover at a higher price than the others on the market which also does not have protective glass because it was written that it was transparent. in reality the back cover is all dotted and with a blue iPhone it's not the best to look at, it should be specified! I certainly wouldn't have bought it;0
1545; Convenient sim but price dropped the next day; good cover although slightly large on the sides where it is not perfect. excellent grip and not slippery. What I found unsatisfactory was the price which dropped by over 30% the following day, a bit unserious.;0
1546;Beautiful it is transparent;I already had an esr cover for my iphone 13 and I was very satisfied even then so I ordered an esr cover for my new phone.shipping and packaging was fast and good. the cover is super transparent. the thing I like most is the comfortable and non-slip grip. the cover seems to be of high quality in terms of workmanship and the material seems very good. the price-performance ratio is unbeatable.;0
1547; Absolutely NOT!; it was on offer for around 9, seeing the price for 3 films and the positive comments, I purchased it. As soon as they arrived I opened them to put one on the screen of my new iPhone 13 pro but for what can I say I open the first one and yes just detach the white tab forcing me to take the film to apply to the screen I throw it away I open the second pull the white tab comes off in the right way as soon as I place it in the guide mask on the phone I apply pressure and it fills with bubbles that don't come off;0
1548;Good but can be improved!;I purchased this film because I had one of the same model for my previous iPhone. this time I found it difficult to apply as air bubbles formed at random. However, nothing to take away from the professionalism and precision of the product. complete with the whole kit it's worth it!;0
1549;iphone screen protector;unfortunately, despite being very careful during application, all three films failed as there were significant bubbles left and I wasn't able to remove them even with the appropriate tool.;0
1550; Good but a bit slippery grip; good value for money also tested with a previous case. perfect for iphone 13 pro with raised edge to protect the rear lenses. the grip is a little slippery but overall it's a good item;0
1551;Pleasantly Surprised...Very Goog..!;cover as described without too much pretension, I make the purchase convinced that I am wasting money. However, I must say that I was pleasantly surprised upon arrival. - First of all, very respectable packaging with a free smartphone holder - you can already tell by touching that you have a good product in your hands. It is very resistant and solid despite not having an exaggerated thickness. - once applied it does its job, it adheres perfectly and what is worth noting is that the photographic compartment is also protected thanks to the raised edges. Recommended purchase;0
1552; Excellent; it's a very nice cover. The only thing that bothers me is that it gets dirty very easily, especially with hand prints and a little slippery to the touch. For the rest, it's excellent. I recommend it because it fits well on the phone, perhaps even too well (for when the you want to remove) it also protects the camera well.. it's nice to note that in the corners of the cover there is a more protected part. and safe for the price it deserves;0
1553; Terrible after-sales service; convenient because it contains everything you need to protect your phone as you see in the video. There is also a convenient phone holder for watching videos and films with your cell phone. the doily is good and also the material of the cover;0
1554; Waste of money; I purchased this cover with ring and watched all the videos etc. I thought a good product. after a month of use it has already turned yellow. hybrid means it won't turn yellow but this one immediately turned yellow. take other brands in my opinion it is better for you;0
1555; Very difficult to remove; solid and well-made cover but very difficult to remove, you risk damaging the phone to do so. Furthermore, the lower front part does not adhere perfectly to the phone and is a little loose by a few millimetres.;0
1556;"UPDATE (17Dec21) - Excellent product... with a ""but"""; excellent product, excellent material that arrives in a complete package with the necessary accessories for a clean installation (frame stickers to remove dust and detergents). It never works for me the first time once eliminated all the bubbles but in the end the result was more than good. just one doubt that I had during the installation phase then turned into reality. the notch sensors (unlike other previous films) are completely covered by the film. the result was that on the first exposure outside in full sunlight the phone's sensor almost darkened the screen and not even when manually raising the lighting to maximum did the display reach its normal brightness (which also resulted in an increase in heat that could be felt on the back of the phone ). this thing has happened to me a couple of times to date. I left the same review on the manufacturer's website but I have not received a response. For other iPhone models in the past this did not happen as the film was shaped in such a way as to maintain the notch discovered. I need to understand if it is a problem that will force me to remove the film.. update 17Dec21 - I was contacted by ESR customer care who immediately offered me a refund or replacement of the product, demonstrating prompt and real attention and care towards the client. I opted for the refund but I am still convinced of the goodness of the ESR products which I have already purchased several times in the past and which for me will continue to be a point of reference for future needs.;0
1557; They are not tempered glass; when I applied the first film I immediately noticed an exaggerated amount of bubbles and dirt that was not present on the screen because it was carefully cleaned and also new. given the situation I immediately decide to replace it. when I go to remove the first film I immediately notice that it is not made of tempered glass given the exaggerated flexibility of it, this should not happen if it is made of real tempered glass. The one in the photo is the second film and as you can see it is full of bubbles and also attracts dirt as if nothing had happened. again from the photo you can see the enormous amount of fingerprints which if it were a normal plastic film they would also be justified but in this case it shouldn't be like that they advertise that they should be resistant to them think a little. product which in practice does not correspond to the declared product purchase not recommended.ps: note of merit is the customer service that contacted me and immediately refunded the films.;0
1558; It alters the colors of the display; simple installation but you have to be careful not to leave fingerprints on the glass once the protection film has been removed as it must be positioned in the frame holding it at the edges as there are no tabs or similar to support it. I can't say about the level of protection give judgments as luckily I didn't drop the phone but I noticed that it alters the colors of the splendid display of the iPhone 13 pro but therefore thinking it was a defect of the first one I removed it and put the second one on with the same result.. removed and ordered something else.;0
1559; perfect; arrived on time thanks to the quality of Amazon. The film is perfect, easy to install and beautiful to look at as the black edges make no difference at all. I gave it 4 stars because I want to test it over time.;0
1560;Excellent!;"excellent product! I bought these protective films for an iPhone 13 pro and I must say that I am more than surprised. I will start by saying that I am terrible at installing this type of protection - in fact I chose this kit primarily because it contains more than one film, I was reassured by the fact of having a ""backup"" in case I had installed it incorrectly...and yet with the frame and the kit supplied the operation was very fast and perfect on the first try! regarding the The films themselves are fairly rigid, once applied they perfectly follow the shape of the smartphone (they leave less than half a millimeter free along the edges, I suppose it is for compatibility with covers of various kinds) and to the naked eye it is as if they were not there";0
1561;Shouldn't they last longer?;I don't know, let's hope fewer bubbles would form. the application was very simple and everything seemed to go right, it adhered perfectly to the screen and worked very well. After a couple of months, perhaps less, bubbles started to form, first small, almost invisible, then a big bubble problem formed at the top. well this shouldn't happen. However, now I will try to change the film with another one that is available as a spare. We will see. For now I'm not satisfied.;0
1562; applicator unusable; the frame that should help center the film is too narrow in an attempt to get it down you have to tinker a lot and in the meantime dust and lint get under the film it is essential to be able to be quick to avoid this. I tried with all three films with little success. I returned it and bought another brand where the applicator worked correctly. Edit I add 2 stars because ESR sent me a replacement product to apologize.;0
1563;Recommended!;I was immediately looking for a protective glass for the new iPhone 13 Pro, intrigued by some positive reviews, I decided to try it. As soon as I opened the package there were three cleaning kits, a handy manual with instructions a plastic guide to correctly insert the glass and the three protective glasses yes 3! the installation is really simple although I am not a champion in applying glass I have practically no air bubbles except for a few but really tiny ones for the moment I am fully satisfied with the product both for the protection it offers which leaves only the ear capsule free and above all for the quality of the price and product 11 euros for this whole kit which is truly excellent! If there is anything new I will try to update the review.;0
1564; Quality; the protective glass has an excellent price/quality ratio. The only flaw is represented by the presence of impurities on the adhesive part so it is not visually beautiful. Another flaw concerns the edges where bubbles appeared. Perhaps it was the lot that I purchased that had these imperfections.;0
1565;I thought better;I honestly thought better. the film adheres well but does not cover the entire screen. about 2 mm remain uncovered on each side. I'm keeping it but I think there are better ones on the market. As for customer service, nothing to say. he never gave me a refund;0
1566;Save your display from scratches and accidental drops? You can do it well and at little expense!; this film is excellent once mounted, you won't even remember it days later! excellent transparency and does not alter the sensitivity of the touch with the fingers! and the package includes 3 films! what more could you want?;0
1567;Easy to install;it's quite easy to install I only had a small problem with a bubble which fortunately later came off. I can't say anything about the resistance yet but for the moment it seems to be going very well;0
1568; Applicator too narrow, low quality adhesive; pros: - glass surface similar to the original - covers the display entirely, leaving less than 1mm on each side;0
1569; Not also; the applicator is comfortable but some films were broken in the corners, one was already dirty and another did not stick well. I bought 2 more boxes and still others, all of which arrived with dirt already present in the glue of the film. I find the control quality of this product shameful edit I ordered other films and they arrived with a different box and without applicator, not a nightmare experience. I buy nothing from this seller anymore, I will give them to friends who don't have OLEDs but I hope they can mount them without a guide;0
1570;Installation tool not included;I chose this item because the description indicated the positioning tool included however it arrived without with two stic chers in theory to be used for centering. obviously, since the first installation was precise to the millimetre, I had to put it back in place by cutting the glass and removing it and putting it back again. the glass appears to be of high quality, however the description is misleading. I needed it and I didn't have time to return it or anything...;0
1571;Does not adhere well and creates bubbles;I installed 2 of the 4 supplied on two different consoles and both are defective in the lower right corner where an air bubble was created that did not disappear. I used the supplied cloths to clean the screen and those to remove dust even though the console was new and just unpacked. I also tried using a plastic card to smooth the film but nothing.;0
1572;Decent;"the frame for adhering the glass is not the correct size. the glass itself is minimally smaller than the glass of the OLED switch (just under a millimeter). I found it slightly protruding"""" compared to glass for previous switch models but I think it depends on the design of the oled model.""";0
1573;Quality/price super ok;in the package there are 4 excellently made glasses designed for the OLED switch...the installation is simple but you need to pay attention to cleaning the glass if you don't want to leave bubbles or imperfections;0
1574;Not the usual thriller;I met Angela Marino through her articles on the fan page and subsequently through her Facebook page. I was always struck by the attention and delicacy with which she describes the news events relating to feminicides and not only that, it came to me spontaneously buy his first reference in kindle format. It's not the usual mystery book in which you slowly discover the murderer but it starts immediately with his arrest and thus outlines all the characters involved who gravitate around the story. It's above all the female protagonists who get inside you. I personally I identified with both the amateur and the violator, retracing a bit of the personal stages that led me to be the person I am today without necessarily having the same experience as the protagonists, I highly recommend this book which I am sure you will devour like me in a very short time.;0
1575; An unusual noir that makes you think; when faced with a heinous crime we often witness a succession of media and non-media events which always have little in common with the investigation. As in a well-established device, there is a succession of searches for hidden truths that shift the attention depending on the interest of a public that morbidly wants to know and know. the secret life of the victim the internal conflicts the about-faces of the people close to her the scandalous background of the culprit the scoops the reactions and the intricate mechanisms of the media machine that plays with the case in question. In Angela Marino's novel, the dynamics of the brutal murder of Diletta Ivak are immediately clear, just as the culprit is immediately tracked down and brought before the judge for preliminary investigations for an initial interrogation. If on the one hand the comparison is reported with the investigating judge on the other, the author allows us to probe and witness everything that happens beyond the investigation, a trial where the accused become numerous and the culprits fade into the background. Hidden Chambers is a story that allows the reader to find and analyze everything that when faced with a crime, an immediate ignition of dynamics that repeat themselves and that we now know well seen from the point of view of a fictionalized story that could be and becomes one of many is unleashed. the intent of the author who in life deals with crime news for fan pages .it is precisely to analyze and dissect the passages that accompany cases like the one reported in this book which borrows and modifies real facts giving the reader the opportunity to form an idea and question himself about what the media world is but also the vast and complex emotional baggage that each story brings with it. A quick and engaging read that leaves a legacy of great reflections on the modern world, on the dynamics and questionable choices that are made when faced with a crime case where the important elements are dispersed ( which continue in the designated classrooms) for the benefit of external changes in the protagonists and in the reactions of public opinion shaped by the media themselves. a narrative experiment of great relevance that helps to understand and reflect the mechanisms of the human mind both in the protagonists of the novel but also in the entire public opinion .;0
1576;Inconclusive;"I usually ""devour"" books of this genre: from the beginning I struggled to get involved, I forcefully resumed the reading left there a few days before in the hope that the story would become interesting in some way but the closure is was even more disappointing than everything else. inconclusive and empty with a reference to the crime of yara gambirasio completely out of context with the intention perhaps of tickling the reader's fantasies, insinuating doubts about the investigation or expressing a veiled personal opinion of the author on that case...completely off topic and really disappointing. shame, I was hoping that at least the ending could contain the twist.";0
1577; Low quality plastic; I was looking for a protector for the front crown when I came across this article. I read a few reviews and I was convinced but only when I received it I realized that it was nothing more than a piece of plastic of very low quality with a carbon effect print. I didn't even try it. I immediately returned it to the seller. Absolutely avoid it;0
1578; Good item; the product arrives rolled up in a box, just connect the cable to the mains and it is ready for use. It is waterproof and heats up to a temperature of around 36 5° centigrade. If we really want to be picky, it doesn't heat up too much. homogeneous for its length but still does its job as you can see in the images on the left it reaches 35° in the central part 36 5° and on the right around 25°. Over time it maintains the temperature quite well with a change of around 1° so when it reaches the temperature it switches off automatically and when it drops by about 1° it starts heating again. I don't know how reliable the heat gun I used is as it is not a professional item I used it solely for demonstration purposes to have an idea of how this mat works.;0
1579;It doesn't work well;I bought it for a gecko terrarium, perhaps it wasn't designed for this purpose but given that as it is written on the mat it should have reached 30°C it would still have been fine. unfortunately, however, not only does it not reach that temperature but it only heats up on the side where the plug is located while the other side heats up minimally. I have others and I know it shouldn't behave like this;0
1580; Don't buy them; I'll start by praising the Amazon shipping, package arrived a day early. Unfortunately I can't say the same about the headphones. I only used them once but I immediately started returning them. I'll explain why: 1) the headphones have very strong bass which disturbs listening a little. I managed to partially remedy this with the smartphone's equalizer.2) I had taken the headphones mainly for running but during the runs they were constantly connecting and disconnecting, in the end the left headphones turned off and never turned back on. obviously the headphones were charged and all this happened after just 15 minutes of running. I don't feel like recommending them to anyone who plays sports.;0
1581;Reliability;I used it for a few days then unfortunately the left earphone stopped working until it worked, good acoustics and excellent durability but I must say that the company contacted me immediately and I had no return problems.;0
1582; the connection does not work; the product is aesthetically well looked after and pleasant to the touch. The headphones easily find their place in the charging box thanks to the magnetic guide. In the 5 minutes in which it worked correctly I was able to appreciate the excellent audio quality, but it's a shame that it didn't last long... I'll start by saying that I read the manual (written in micrometric characters) and followed the instructions to the letter. The initial pairing took place without any problems. I tried them for 5 minutes and they seemed to work fine. everything was fine, then I put them back in the charging box and put everything back on charge until the green LED indicating charging > 90% appeared. When I tried them again in the evening with the same device they continued to stop working and the disk stopped working. . Resetting the headphones and unpairing and re-pairing from the device were of no use: initially it seemed to connect and the audio playback started but after a handful of seconds it was promptly interrupted by the jingle played in the headphones of the disco connection followed by that of the reconnection and so on on repeat. After more than 1 hour of vain attempts I threw in the towel and asked for a return. Excellent Amazon service in organizing the return and refund. In conclusion: potentially an excellent product but the problem with connectivity makes it unusable and without a service of dedicated assistance it is not possible to try to solve the problem (the manual is really sparse and only shows the reset procedure). I can't judge the battery life as I haven't had the opportunity to test it thoroughly.;0
1583;We're not there!;I bought them trusting the many positive reviews but unfortunately I returned them and I'll explain why. it means that if you are carrying out a sporting activity where the device is not necessarily close to you such as the gym and the audio tracks are not all at the same volume level you will have to go back and forth from the device to adjust it. it means that you will have to the same thing if you go from one radio station to another since usually the audio is never at the same level. but to make matters worse there is also another problem, that is, in the case of non-connection of the disc and subsequent re-connection you will have to go on the device to readjust the volume you had previously set since in this case it automatically goes to the minimum level. What a shame! They could have been excellent earphones.;0
1584;Good value for money but....;the earphones are easily connected to the phone following a now standard procedure. the quality of listening to music is good in relation to the price, they can be heard very loudly even if the sound spectrum is rather unbalanced towards low frequencies. the phone calls are loud, sometimes you are heard well, other times the interlocutors claim to hear the metallic voice. after a few days of use, even after being fully charged, the phone often detected that the batteries were at 10% charge and probably for this reason one earphone occasionally turned off. I had to return them.;0
1585; Lasts 11 minutes; once removed from the box associated with the telephone, a first 11 mm phone call is made. Everything is OK. from the second phone call only the left worked. I did various resets, dissociations and re-associations but only the left one still worked. I returned them. the quality still seemed decent to me for 30 headphones, nothing miraculous or audiophile.;0
1586; Good; to be honest, I have yet to fully test them, however at first glance they seem to be of good quality. The case they come in is very nice and well-finished. the sound is very clear even if the volume at maximum is not very high. very good quality/price I recommend them... update: defective headphones started returned;0
1587;Good but...;the headphones feel good the charging box is small and convenient the controls seem good and respond to the touch quickly and easily unfortunately I can't turn them off even though the instructions say that they can be turned off by placing them in the custody. so they continue to be connected to the phone even when they are in the case and the only way I have found is to dissociate them from the Bluetooth connection and it is clearly very inconvenient.;0
1588; Excellent value for money; excellent packaging, easy to configure (advice: follow the instructions carefully otherwise you will be racking your brain for nothing) excellent sound and fits well in the ear. aesthetically beautiful too. The bright LEDs are also excellent;0
1589; Embarrassing sound quality; excellent, almost excessive noise isolation. the sound quality is unpresentable, it seemed to me like those headphones that sold for 5 euros 10 years ago. I got another brand at the same price and it's a different world. absolutely not recommended;0
1590; Mediocre; the charging case cover was defective and I had to return it. However, it still has decent ergonomics even if the sound quality is mediocre in my opinion. Amazon's returns service is excellent.;0
1591;Maybe good for music but not for making calls;arrive and immediately try to make calls.even though I was in a silent room without noises or disturbances, my interlocutor did not hear my words, finding them muffled and distorted.immediately returned.;0
1592; Excellent but I caught the defective ones; the headphones themselves are excellent and have good sound quality. The problem is that when I put them back in the case the headphones don't disconnect but remain constantly connected. I'm very sorry because they seemed really excellent. I made the return.;0
1593;Bad product;bad product as it doesn't do what it is made for: you can't quickly connect the touch keys, they don't work or once you connect to the PC you can't control the volume. bad experience I'll give it back;0
1594; Excellent product; the headphones are wrapped in a protective film. In the manual there is also an explanation in Italian. Excellent battery life of the headphones and the case. It adheres and wraps perfectly on the ear with its soft plastic. After a few minutes it doesn't seem When wearing them, the response is good when paired with the phone and a good sound for music. In addition to wearing them for sports, I also wear them at home, receiving good results even with the phone away. five star quality price;0
1595; Meh; fantastic headphones the first few days after not even 1 month from the one on the right you can hear the audio much lower. thanks to the positive reviews that made me lose 30 probably written by the relatives of those who created the headphones. don't buy them, all headphones under 100 are Chinese;0
1596;The game is not worth the candle.;I'll start by saying that I don't suffer from bad odors from sweating but I still wanted to try this product. I tried it for a week and I didn't like it at all. with this product I managed to smell bad odors in the underarm area a couple of times, which doesn't happen with normal roll-ons. the smell itself is fresh, pleasant and not strong at first, it takes a while for it to dry. furthermore the price at least for me made the game not worth the candle. with classic roll ons from other brands I spend less and I don't have sweating problems.;0
1597;I MAY HAVE BEEN UNLUCKY BUT....;I purchased this cam for the reviews and the qualities advertised but it was all a disaster. I have two iPhone cell phones and only the older one was able to tune in to the cam... the newer one (iphone 12) just can't find it. installed via the cam network I noticed a low image quality.... I have several cams that I use mainly for alarms and which have ninth quality 1 or 2 which are clearly better of this one that boasts of having 4k! I was absolutely unable to receive images once connected to the wifi: the cam finds the wifi network and says to connect, after which it is completely offline. Returned within a couple of hours;0
1598;It's not 4k and it doesn't even reach FULL HD!!!;the positive 5-star reviews are either fake (coincidentally they are all concentrated in a few days... a classic) or are done in a superficial and not in-depth manner. the camera does not exceed 1280 to 720 points of video resolution (this is why many complain about the low quality in 4k... I believe it!!). on the other hand, to have a decent flow in 4k you would need to have (gopro docet) very high speed SD cards, which is not specified or recommended anywhere in the manual. in short, a beautiful sun! returned like a rocket. beware;0
1599;It works but has some problems;the micro camera is micro, nothing to say. in its operation it does its duty, it records and even in live the voice can be heard really well. excellent shooting in the dark and the motion detection also works. even too much. despite the possibility of 3 degrees of sensitivity, even with the lowest, the slightest movement is detected. The application and association between video camera and phone was not exactly immediate. at the beginning it really didn't work and then by magic they always did the same operations. They paired via home wifi. Here's the sore point for me. the application allows you to use your phone's hotspot when you are away from home so great thing. the problem is that this connection is difficult, laborious and infinite and as for the installation when you least expect it you will find it with none. In short it takes patience. Through the application there is also the possibility of recording in the cloud but it is a service to almost 4 dollars a week up to 90 dollars a month. nothing to complain about instant notifications when the camera detects movement but this only if the camera is connected to a wifi ... other notes: there is the function to detect only the movement in certain areas of the shooting field to start the recording (in order to exclude movements of leaves moved by the wind or areas of continuous passage). another problem... the settings often reset as does the recording quality which by default does not It's in HD.;0
1600;Another disappointment;the ninth press around from the photos you will understand camera inside the house with the active wi-fi network I have fiber so no problems from the internet but from the camera which does not stay connected for more than 2 seconds and when if with Nonetta she couldn't get inside... the other thing was the very bad night recording;0
1601; It does what it promises; it is not very small, a cube of about 3cm on each side so if it is not hidden it stands out. It works in wi-fi and 4G mode with the mobile phone, the range of use is about twenty meters but I noticed its absence signal even at a shorter distance. Once the connection is lost, the latter is not automatically restored and it is necessary to repeat the WiFi connection procedure between the phone and the camera. The app menu is simple to use. Among the many functions, you can review the videos saved in the camera's memory (in actually saved on your phone) and those on the micro SD however I still haven't understood how the motion alert works because I don't receive any notification. It's really a shame about the short length of the videos in motion detection, maximum 2 minutes. A notable flaw in my opinion is that the boasted fov of 150° is a value written only on the box. the device does not have a wide-angle lens and the shooting range is well below 120°, the video quality is good, of course, the UHD function is a pure invention but you certainly cannot expect anything more from this object (with this price). However, the duration of the battery life is surprising. internal battery in detection mode I exceeded 2 hours of battery life. Recommended product, worth the purchase;0
1602; it doesn't correspond to the description at all; it's a mess to install even if there are instructions, it's hard to read the wiffi and not stop! during the day at first you could see very well (even though I used it twice) but now it's all blurry... at night however even if it has the flash you can't understand anything. the battery runs down very easily!!! the recording on the micro SD is not even saved but it always remains on the *local* memory of the microcamera then if you want to record when you are away you have to go to the app from your phone and record (on the video) as soon as you leave the app it doesn't record nothing more !issodisffata!;0
1603;In the end I connected it and it works;I have to correct my previous review because after several attempts I managed to connect it to the wi-fi. unfortunately the instructions in the booklet and the app had led me astray. There's no need to let the camera read the QR code, just look for it among the available wi-fi lines (mine is IPC) and ignore it and then follow the instructions on the screen. anyway he does his job discreetly.;0
1604; Excellent video camera but...; it has a good resolution and the night vision is also decidedly excellent. the only sore point is on the network settings. it is not as simple as described in the instructions. It's a bit difficult to understand if it has read the QR code created with the network settings. The sore point is that you cannot manually set the WiFi network to which it will refer. you can only change the various wifi settings only if you can connect it to a network and only if it is with and under that network. if you move location and want to set the new network you have to repeat the procedure with the qrcode ( too cumbersome). It would be easier to make the settings available for manual connection.;0
1605;No wifi connection;it would have been a good product but.. it cannot connect to the home wifi network in any way. I watched the video guide and read the instructions from other users who have purchased the same product but unfortunately without success. I don't feel like advertising the product badly because I've never had the chance to make it work.;0
1606; Either I was unlucky or it's a package; so as regards app installation, cam synchronization, everything is fine, video quality is not excellent but acceptable, the problem arises when you activate the audio, a simple hello is enough to activate a very annoying echo, moreover it creates disturbances with other devices electronic devices, for example, I have an iPhone 12 Pro, I made a phone call and it also caused disturbances during the call, echo interference, etc. I don't know if I have a faulty product, the fact is that it is unusable. I returned it;0
1607; Terrible; purchased based on the reviews but total disappointment. Almost total absence of instructions. poor quality immediately loses connection with the router. Then it will be small but it is not possible to define it as a spy camera.;0
1608; I use it at home in the kitchen with my mobile phone; the camera works quite well. I am not an expert in assembling electronic devices but using the instruction booklet after 10 minutes I was able to understand well how it worked. I use it at home in the kitchen with my mobile phone. I tried shooting in low light and it shows a little. I like it mostly because of the small size.;0
1609;resolution;I bought this product mainly because I saw that the resolution could go up to 4k but in reality the resolution is only 360p, changing resolution from 720p to 4k didn't change anything. for the rest everything is fine.;0
1610; Connection to the network not working therefore setup impossible; impossible to connect the camera to my wifi network despite several attempts. difficult to understand why since there is no troubleshooting instruction and the error messages are not very informative.;0
1611; excellent video quality; cheap camera with mediocre video quality. among the features that I appreciated most are: the clear instruction manual and completely in Italian, the night mode although difficult to use;0
1612; Headphones; very nice headphones with unstable attachment to the ear, the sound does not have the bass as described, it is poor. To be able to hear the bass decently I have to press very hard inside the ear and when I release them they disappear. as a result the sound becomes very poor.;0
1613;Nice comfortable meh;they are beautiful and comfortable, don't expect a great stereo performance and bass but in my opinion it is impossible to find headphones in such a format at that price, but I use them if I want to listen to music with continuous sound quality, the old conventional ones.;0
1614; Strong buzz on the left; one of. two headphones you could hear a strong buzz right from the first pairing... I tried to reset everything but unfortunately without positive results... let's hope it's just a single case of mine because all in all the aesthetics and the fit of the headphones were ergonomic;0
1615;Structural defects;this tool itself is well designed. the possibility of quickly replacing the blades is an ingenious and useful thing. unfortunately I have to say that as soon as the small cutter was mounted on the round neck drill the set screw lost its hold probably due to the poor quality (antimony?) and the blade it was running in circles. However, I solved the problem by putting an old Allen screw that I had among the scrap in storage after having worn out and thinned the part of the bottom of the drill bit (which serves to center the hole) where the set screw meets the tip. in this way the screw threads deeper and is able to block the tip well. the fact remains that I had to adapt and remedy a structural defect;0
1616; Unsuitable for running; I bought them for running. From the second run onwards, after about 30 minutes, either due to sweat or false contact with the skin, the headphones start to turn off and on, continuously disconnecting and reconnecting (between themselves and the device). on the last 10km then it also started to pause the app for running, making me lose information on pace and distance and therefore basically on time. It's not good for the gym but I'm returning it because it's not suitable for running. For the rest, audio quality mediocre extreme cut on the bass (so much so that I had to reset the equalizers of the playback apps). good seal in light in-ears. touch not extremely performing.;0
1617;Insufficient charging wire;I didn't like them: they are uncomfortable and inefficient and the charging wire is too short. a piece of advice: let's avoid selling stuff like this, it's just a waste of time for you and the customer.;0
1618; They have clear and crystalline sound; headphones purchased to associate them with the television for listening to music and TV programs completely touchscreen and without physical buttons all managed through the number of touchscreens the quality is average decent musical stereo which allows you to listen to stereophonic music practically 4.0 lacks that bit of bass in the music but overall they are excellent. disappointing battery;0
1619; Change of rating after a couple of months of use; perfect earphones in various aspects: thanks to their rubber arm they remain stable from the ear and do not fall out. Perfect sound both when listening to music and during phone calls. Their case It is also a convenient recharger with charge indicator. They can even work only one at a time. Update After a long period of use I unfortunately have to change the rating to negative - it has never started to crackle or discharge - the battery life has been significantly reduced - i my interlocutors complain that they cannot hear me during calls. If these problems would have arisen during the period in which I could have made the withdrawal I would not have hesitated to return but now I am forced to keep them like this even if the use is very limited.;0
1620; Smart watch; easy connection with the app downloadable from the guide, comfortable rubber strap, large and readable screen, convenient functions but which drastically reduce the battery, small 180mah battery which, without particular use, does not last even 2 days, using some functions it must be recharged in the evening (such as the mobile phone) I would like to know who keeps it on standby for 7 days (as stated) this last one is a big flaw which makes me evaluate the return;0
1621;Having arrived a few days ago, I am not able to evaluate it;what I like: aesthetically it looks good. It has a nice bright and easy to read dial. What is questionable: the strap being made of rubber is not very practical to wear. it fits easily. Then one thing I counted on at the time of purchase and which I always cared about for practicality is the measurement of blood pressure and heart rate. with this watch both the heart rate and blood pressure measurements are approximate. I compared them with the electronic sphygmomanometer measurement. For the other characteristics I am not able to make an evaluation for now.;0
1622; Unreliable values; aesthetically very nice but when put to the test I was able to verify that both the sporting values and all the others were overestimated and not by a little and therefore not reliable at all. Overall two/three stars just for aesthetics. returned immediately;0
1623;I don't recommend it;I bought these headphones since the ones I had previously abandoned me are terrible the sound quality is not worth the cost I'm not saying they have to have impeccable quality but for the same money you can find headphones that compared to these they are heaven every time there was a higher or lower sound they started to freeze and made a very annoying noise (with very normal songs with which other headphones had never given me problems) furthermore the button is very uncomfortable as it is not touch you have to press the earphone in the ear and with ios at least when a call arrives the sound does not reach the earphones but goes to the phone very bad sends back within 2 days.;0
1624;BAD IF NOT RIDICULOUS;as soon as you open the impression that it is a low quality product you can see it from the lid of the case in a very light transparent plastic. try listening to music and you get even more confirmation that it is a low quality product. they reach the top (negatively) with call use. wearing both, the interlocutor can barely hear the voice with a hostile perception percentage of less than 50 percent. I will return it immediately;0
1625; Fantastic sound; you can hear the right bass very well, they are perfect and at this price compared to others they are a must have. I have to give 4 stars and not 5 because they are a little uncomfortable compared to other models that are not in-ear (which I prefer) and you have to clean the earwax thoroughly at least once a day otherwise it's not good (which doesn't happen or is less evident with on ear headphones);0
1626; The headphones do not last 5-7 hours as described; I would have liked to give 5 stars, the product quality/price is excellent. pity that the headphones last no more than 4 hours.... which is enough but in the product description it says 5/7 hours. otherwise the product is excellent.;0
1627;"Very light ""rectification""";excellent retractable wireless headphones are extremely light so much so that you can't feel them on them, they are equipped with a double button, one touch and one classic to manage the different functions. the audio quality is really good and the ear dome completely cuts you off from the outside world. the battery lasts more than 4 hours running and during phone calls the interlocutor hears the voice well. All things considered, they are an excellent compromise between quality and price. I am satisfied. Correction dated 2/12/21. The headphones have stopped working. I will try to contact the seller and see how he behaves.;0
1628; excellent mat; it is a good, very beautiful and functional mat. 4 stars only because it is USB 2 so even by connecting it to the USB 3 ports the transfer via the integrated USB hub is a bit slow. It's a shame, really, if they had made it USB 3 it would have been perfect ;0
1629; Nice and cheap but not the best; this mouse mat has a good fabric that didn't give me problems with the sensitivity of the mouse, it also has a USB hub on the edge that can be used to connect accessories such as mice or keyboards and many others and this cable, once connected to the PC, allows the edges of the mat to be illuminated and to change color there is a button above the USB hub which is really very convenient;0
1630; The color does not match; the box is very beautiful and arrived not exactly on time. color? it's wrong. red and pink are two completely different colors. no matter where I could have ordered it red. I needed it to arrive pink for a ninth birthday present.;0
1631;Is this device worth it? Ni....;I gave 3 stars to this pseudo tlc/dash because I had to express an opinion between 1 star and 5 stars. Initially quite enthusiastic about the product, the kit is easy to install even on a car and the image is quite clear but only later did I realize that I had probably stumbled upon a defective item as it did not record at all on the micro SD, a fundamental point for safety and the main reason for the purchase. Unfortunately, I had to ask for a return and with Amazon I had never had the possibility of no, replace it, because after an experience like this, a customer would never show reliability by playing their cards on a second episode. In conclusion, I can say that if the TLC is intact, it does its job very well if..... if the camera is intact! the quality ratio price should be excellent. it should.....nb it is not compatible with any app on playstore.;0
1632; Returned; the feeling is that it wouldn't even hold a weight of 70kg if one brushed it in the shower. Maybe I'm wrong anyway, I took it out of the box and put it back in the box. Drilling holes in the majolica for a product that maybe gives way after a few months I didn't feel like it ;0
1633; Zero rating; aesthetically and in the photo it looks very nice... but it is not functional at all, it feels very low and has no possibility of directing the audio output inside the ear hole... terrible purchase. .. zero rating;0
1634; Uncomfortable; for those like me who use it for several hours it becomes uncomfortable and annoying for the ear. The volume is not very high probably because it doesn't stay attached well. The refill is very functional and the design is beautiful but I returned it.;0
1635; Terrible audio; I don't know if it's faulty or not but the audio quality is terrible, it feels very low and above all it vibrates but even those on the other end report feeling sick and far away, the cancellation of background noise is almost nothing. fortunately amazon accepts the return;0
1636; no one can hear me; the product comes in its box and its packaging which also acts as a recharger (which actually attracted me but it lacks in its most important function: the audio in reception but above all in transmission is very low .in practice my interlocutors hear me slowly and I also hear little. conclusion I asked for a return.;0
1637; THEY ARRIVED BUT DIFFERENT FROM THE THOSE ON SALE; I don't know if it's a bad thing or a good thing but the headphones that I received are aesthetically very different from the ones I bought. these are the same as the old model but without the jack. This is why I give 1 star, I don't send them back simply because I need them immediately.;0
1638; Product returned; the product was aesthetically beautiful and of a reasonable price, unfortunately to work you have to activate Bluetooth and the right earphone crackled / had interference. I returned the product and purchased the original;0
1639; Different from the ones in the photo; I have yet to try them. the cartridge is not like the ones they offer but they are like in the photo. when you turn the cartridge you feel that the ink is not filling the tank and it moves. somewhat perplexed, Amazon should check whether the product corresponds to what is offered;0
1640; Purchase consciously; purchased for listening to music during daily walks. Previously I used earphones without the plastic hook over the ear which often did not maintain the required position. With these the problem is solved at least as far as I am concerned concerns but I would like to point out that my activity consists of walking at a fast pace and in the case of a run or gym exercises, as these earphones are very light I cannot say anything about their durability. Expected sound quality for earphones of this price with not much bass obvious and highs a little too high. However, it depends a lot on the sound quality of the files being played and the tastes of the listener. So far it has never lost connection and they have never been downloaded during use. Music playback stops in the event of phone calls The insulation is good but fortunately it doesn't prevent you from hearing a car or anything else coming from behind. In conclusion it's what you expect for the price you pay. For something of better quality you have to go to other ranges cost but it wasn't what I was interested in.;0
1641;Review;I highly recommend avoiding the product. after leaving a bad review I started having problems. earphones that were very bad and jerky. you can hear hissing during calls. avoid it. 40 euros cost.;0
1642; FFp2 black; the package contains exactly 50 masks. I haven't tried them yet but comparing them with others I've already purchased they seem sturdy and not too thin. they are slightly smaller than others but adhere well to the face (perhaps not suitable for large faces). I am satisfied.;0
1643;The laces are too short;the product itself wouldn't be bad but the laces are really too short for an adult, both for a woman and even more so for a man. Furthermore, having had to try one, I can't even return it. Too bad 2 or 3 cm more lace would have made a positive difference.;0
1644; Adequate product; average product, standard size elastics which are neither too soft nor tight, even if pulled they do not come off. Individually packaged masks, therefore convenient to have in stock in your bag and car. Slightly thinner structure than other comparable products.;0
1645;Masks;I really like that they adhere to the face, all in all the elastic doesn't hurt me behind the ears even though they are not very suitable for a man's face. It doesn't make your face sweat once you put it on, the internal fabric is a bit plasticky. good quality;0
1646; TOO easy to remove; total disappointment. I tried putting them in sockets but they didn't stick, leaving a few millimeters of space. obviously the baby removed them in a second and even less time to put it in his mouth. the little thing to protect it from the current has itself become dangerous. Returns are not recommended and are dangerous.;0
1647; Functional but a little uncomfortable; having a child at home it can always happen that he has something thin in his hands and nothing stops him from sticking it into a socket. These socket covers are excellent for both ordinary sockets and round sockets. The only inconvenient thing is that it is difficult to remove them from round sockets as they are truly minimalist in design. However, they do their job well.;0
1648; To be evaluated better; purchased as a Christmas gift. I reserve the right to review the functioning later. Delivery times and packaging were perfect. I opened the product and only tried it to see if it worked: good length of the cable Good quality remote control with various functions. The mat is too thin. It seems to take too long to heat up but I'll check later.;0
1649;I thought better;despite changing the temperature to a higher level, the heat is very low and you can't use it at all. Money badly spent on the same day I asked for a return. I won't buy it again;0
1650; Rapid heating and thermo-preserving fabric; as the title suggests, it works very well, the heating is very fast and the fabric already heats up properly and consequently retains the heat for longer, therefore excellent for heating a bed before getting into it, consumption is very reduced compared to other models but guarantees excellent performance. easy to use with the wired controller already connected, a few simple buttons to turn on and increase the intensity of the heat. the fabric can easily be washed in the washing machine but I still recommend gentleness and above all not folding the heating pad during use because the plates during operation they are delicate and may not fall apart, always use it flat. In short, the price is very good and should be considered essential.;0
1651; SMALL; this mat (it is not a cushion because it is not padded) is made of very soft fabric that is pleasant to the touch. the dimensions are the following: 58 by 30 cm (therefore less than the 60 cm present in the description). the remote control wire ends with an Italian 2-plug socket;0
1652;Simple but quite effective.;Whether you use it only to warm up during the winter or to relieve muscle pain, this electric heating pad from Sinocare could be a panacea for the body.The dimensions are quite small but sufficient (30 by 60 cm) . the very soft external material is 100% polyester, hand and machine washable at 30°c after removing the power cable. it is possible to set the temperature in 6 levels (40/45/48/52/56/60°c) with rapid heating and the timer in 4 levels (30/60/90/120 minutes). the duration must be checked in the time but at the moment I can consider my experience with this article made in China positive. (price as of today 29.99);0
1653;Be careful with the keys;you have to force it a bit to insert it, it almost seems like it's the right size but it's perfect. I recommend the really classy light blue color but some keys on the keyboard don't match so sending it back;0
1654; purchase to be avoided; the product is much smaller than it appears in the photo on the Amazon website and the sensors don't work well because the disc sometimes hits the furniture violently. Amazon is terrible considering that for the collection with the courier I had had to pay. 5 75.;0
1655; Terrible!!!; It's not clear from the video and the photo but it's very poor and very small!!! It's really a terrible purchase! Don't buy it. Its value is 2. It's ridiculous!!!! If you buy it as a gift to make a fool of yourself, it's guaranteed!;0
1656; LEFT EARPHONE ARRIVED BROKEN; product ordered and arrived defective. I would like a new product to be sent to me which works perfectly. Available to manage the return at no additional cost to me. If instead I had to manage the return at my expense I would obviously consider the purchase of another headset and I would consider the after-sales service terrible. Amazon prime delivery perfect as always.;0
1657;They are worth what they cost...;the sound quality is not great even compared to other products of the same cost. aesthetically the headset is nice but the charging bottle is made with poor quality plastic which highlights its cheap appearance. furthermore, touch recognition is slow and not precise. they are functional and those looking for 20 earphones in this case have exactly what they are buying but the quality is definitely found elsewhere.;0
1658; Good but not suitable for music; decent product purchased on offer but in my opinion suitable mainly for general use not for music. the telephone audio is still good and the interlocutor hears well. I also found some difficulty with the double tap to adjust the volume, you have to try several times to find the right rhythm so that it receives the right command, most of the time it interprets it as a pause. personally at full price I don't know if I would buy them again.;0
1659;For calls they are not good;I bought the headphones mainly to use them on the telephone and three different interlocutors connecting them also on different devices confirmed to me that they did not hear me well. for music they are good. I requested a return.;0
1660; I didn't like them; headphones not so comfortable to wear, you can hear the audio well but different from the headset I had before, a better quality mono one, let's not talk about if you want to end a call you have to click a lot of times and you'll break the bank ear because the earphone fits in more, sometimes it takes straight away, sometimes not and you can't end the call or a video you see on your cell phone for music I gave up then the little box that indicates the battery level after being used three times was turned off anyway, an uncomfortable product for me, not easy to use, easy only to connect to the cell phone but not to the disk.;0
1661; microphone not up to par; headphones of decent quality. It has an excellent quality/price ratio considering that I purchased it at a discount. during phone calls the microphone does not seem up to par with the headphones themselves. the other party cannot hear well even after wearing both;0
1662;One earphone doesn't work;I was enthusiastic about the item when I opened the package because I really liked it: the bar of soap that contains the earphones is beautiful with the view of the charge when the box is closed. However, this enthusiasm didn't last long: one of the two earphones didn't work. I left them to charge even though they were 100% charged but even after that it continued to not work. I'll do the return on Monday. too bad. updated Wed 1 December: I had given only one star but it didn't seem right. I just returned it and within 2 days they charged me the money on my card, excellent! instead of buying them again (I think I was just unlucky, I think it could happen that an item arrives defective) I changed the model and bought a model without the hook on the ears. I bought them because the reviews said that they were great for the gym but I noticed that sometimes they get lost. with these that I returned this would not have happened.;0
1663; Another faulty cinematographer; produced in China and purchased with other earphones in the same price range and from the same origin, they turned out to be the worst ever: when the package was opened, worn and synchronized, they were immediately found to be extremely uncomfortable due to their excessive size, the touch of the right earphone stops to work after one minute making it unusable. immediately put back in the case and repackaged five minutes after opening the package it will be returned to the sender. impractical.;0
1664;Nice but nothing special!!!;the product is too bulky and the case should keep itself open while you take the headphones. the part around the ear is too soft that it falls on the bike when I take ditches. they seem very fragile but in any case based on the price you can't expect much efficiency. The touch part to raise the volume or change music is also confusing. you should be flash to double touch to raise the volume and triple touch to change the music with the right headphones.;0
1665; Audio ok, perfect comfort, terrible touch button!!!; the design, comfort and optimal battery life but the touch button was terrible for answering a call, I was piercing my eardrum by pressing it. from this point of view very disappointed!!!! poor quality/price ratio;0
1666; Bought after 4 years of Apple headphones; I think I'll go back to Apple even if not at the same price. like any headphones with rubber they don't fit me well. I can't laugh or make a face that escapes from my ears. and the hooks are useless. I haven't tried them while running yet. The touch controls seem to work well enough and the sound isn't bad. I'm returning them.;0
1667;Too big for a woman;I purchased these headphones to be able to use them for tracking. the packaging and headphones are nice and seem solid. As soon as I put them on, however, I realized that they had a hook that was too big for me as I'm a girl and they don't stay attached to my ears during head movements. I therefore had to return them. I think they are more suitable for men.;0
1668; Terrible headphones for everyday use; I must admit that I had a really bad time with these headphones, they are really uncomfortable and I don't recommend purchasing them, the audio is really bad. I thought the positive reviews were real but in reality they are not;0
1669;Disappointment heats little or nothing.;I purchased this product after reading 13 reviews out of 13 with 5 stars. unfortunately the socks that arrived set to the maximum heat level heat little or nothing. I just started the return process.;0
1670;Mobile phone holder that does its job well and with a good quality/price ratio.;I tried this mobile phone holder both with the suction cup bracket and with the attachment to the ventilation fins. in the first case it is too bulky for me and on my camera it covers the view a bit. my rating is therefore 4 stars, absolutely deserved (if over time there are problems, I will report them). And to show some of the details described, the shape of this support is as it is when attached to the vents, I will insert some photos. I hope it helped bye!;0
1671;The air conditioning mount is impractical;this car mount is not bad taken as a whole. It arrives home with two different attachments, one from the dashboard/glass and one from the air conditioning vent. The actual support is finished very well in carbon fiber (I believe fake) in the center and rubberized at all points where it comes into contact with the mobile phone so as not to scratch or ruin anything. The suction cup arm is very useful for applying the support to the windshield or dashboard as long as the latter is almost flat. The suction cup is made of a washable sticky material such as that for removing hair of sweaters and once stuck the suction cup must be vacuum-packed by pulling the clamp. The arm also has various adjustments both in length and in height so that you can position the phone as you wish. As for the air conditioning vent support, I honestly find it not very stable and impractical it protrudes too much and is too long to be able to rest comfortably on the dashboard so as not to vibrate. Overall I rate this support positively if you have to use only the arm otherwise as a support for the air conditioning vent it is better to orient yourself on something of dedicated. the price at the moment is 14 euros which all in all is good considering everything.;0
1672;For the price it seems OK;I much prefer the suction cup cell phone holders to the ones that attach to the air vents as they don't heat up my cell phone in the winter when I turn on the heat in the car.this product is very basic: it has a suction cup that attaches to the dashboard (for now it is not 0;0
1673; comfortable; the headphones are good both in terms of construction quality and comfort and once worn the audio is quite mediocre at maximum volume, the sounds muddy a bit then I read in the comments that it has exaggerated bass but not and absolutely so the bass is balanced with the other frequencies and does not prevail if you want headphones with truly subwoofer bass that makes your eardrum tremble without distorting at a price in line with these are mpow flame uglier but the audio level that it has ninth compared to these and like comparing a panda to a lamborghini;0
1674;After a few days they no longer turned on;from the beginning the headphones did not turn on when I removed them from their case. pairing with the cell phone was quite difficult. after a few days of use they no longer turned on even though they were fully charged. Amazon customer service was excellent as usual: they accepted the return and reimbursed me for the expense.;0
1675; Used for half an hour...; the product looks good for being so cheap. but...after trying it for half an hour once the right earphone battery ran out I couldn't charge them. the charging indicator didn't work and in fact it wasn't charging. exactly like the automatic activation function once removed from the case and the LEDs. a disaster. returned immediately.;0
1676;For those who want to train without giving up music;excellent Bluetooth headphones for those who want to train and run without worrying that the headphones might fall. It happened to me several times that I had to stop while I was running because the headphones had slipped from my ear because the sweat prevented the rubber from sealing in the ear. Then one day I met a friend who had the same headphones as me but with a splendid headband that it held firmly to my ear so I decided to buy these headphones which are truly extraordinary, they connect quickly to Bluetooth, they have a decent battery life and they have excellent audio for listening to everything, music and radio in general. I highly recommend them to anyone who wants to play sports in the company of excellent music. ps they broke after less than a month of use.;0
1677; Data not true; I purchased it only for the pressure measurement function but unfortunately the data is not true. the ma for by 20 points, the min by 7 points less and even the oxygen measurement is not precise, it is three points negative, battery life and everything else is ok;0
1678; Nice graphics but poor in content; the smart watch looks good in appearance and construction but in practical use it is absolutely unreliable for detecting blood pressure and oxygenation. It's cheap but it promises performance that doesn't actually work. ultimately it is a good step counter watch, discreet as a heart rate monitor, useless as a blood pressure monitor;0
1679; It's good for knowing the time and nothing more; bought to go walking every morning, it's really well made, you can see the writing and icons very well, the battery lasts a long time and it's easy to use, I didn't want more from a smartwatch . advice;0
1680;Unreliable headphones.;I like both the design and sound quality. It stops well on the light ear. I use it both for work and for physical activity. I forget I have it. clean and crisp sound. indication of the retailer corresponding to the contents of the package.;0
1681;It didn't charge a headset;unfortunately a headset didn't charge, I was probably particularly unlucky. I preferred to return it. There are plenty of other similar and still valid products. the return service was impeccable as always...;0
1682;Defective product;disgusting! the product arrived defective... just as long as I sat down and listened to two songs the headphones ran out of battery... so far so good. the problem arose when, once placed in the box that was supposed to recharge them, they remained dead. the box did not charge and the headphones remained unusable after only ten minutes of use.;0
1683; Disappointment; I totally disagree with the reviews that precede me. The product is potentially valid with small dimensions and weight, probably the thinnest wifi cam (no more small attention!) currently present on amz. In practice however it turns out to be a product of mediocre quality, completely without a wide angle lens and with a dedicated app that is very poor in features and very poorly made. Shaky wifi connection and disheartening battery. The last gem is the instruction booklet written in an almost incomprehensible pseudo-Italian language. It certainly costs little, this is true. But it's worth just as much .;0
1684; Data not true; I purchased it only for the pressure measurement function but unfortunately the data is not true. the ma for by 20 points, the min by 7 points less and even the oxygen measurement is not precise, it is three points negative, battery life and everything else is ok;0
1685; Nice graphics but poor in content; the smart watch looks good in appearance and construction but in practical use it is absolutely unreliable for detecting blood pressure and oxygenation. It's cheap but it promises performance that doesn't actually work. ultimately it is a good step counter watch, discreet as a heart rate monitor, useless as a blood pressure monitor;0

1687;Small size;I give 2 stars to the product because half of the cards (the glasses and mustache) are so small that they seem to be for children and therefore unusable for adults;0
1688; Excellent value for money; the audio is good, the highs are a little sparkling but it's a matter of taste. the connection is simple and they never risk falling out of your ears, sufficient battery life and nice container/charger.;0

1690; A good product; listening to music with good quality, being able to answer a call from your smartphone, working on a computer without disturbing those next to you and much more is what these comfortable stereo headphones allow you to do in complete freedom thanks to the Bluetooth 5.0 wireless technology and CVC 6.0 noise canceling technology. But let's go into detail by considering two main factors that could influence the purchase of these headphones. the first is in the price since at the time of the review it is not possible to see the price, no less important is the possibility of being able to use the two headphones independently even for calls so in practice we will be able to use 2 different devices and pair an earphone for each one. packaging let's start with very beautiful packaging and which at first impression can suggest that you are faced with a good quality product, once opened it contains everything you need to make the best use of these headphones or the headphones themselves the charging bottle a cable to connect to a transformer (not included) or to any device equipped with USB output and a pair of silicone adapters. Charging box The charging bottle is made of plastic with a non-slip coating and measures a few cm therefore very small and discreet and is equipped with a good battery which gives the possibility of having a long autonomy. on the outside we will find a small display with the charging percentage of the battery with indicators also for the individual earphones once inserted inside it will turn off and will automatically dissociate from the device with it. same thing for when we go back to using them, just take them out of the case and the earphones will perform the pairing between them and the device we paired previously. earphones and pairing the earphones are very light and very ergonomic, they are in-ear and waterproof therefore good in gym or running, once inserted into the ear, they adapt very well to the auricle and even with sudden movements we will hardly risk losing them. in any case, as previously mentioned, inside the package we will find a pair of adapters which will allow for a better grip. The sound quality is truly remarkable, clean and with good bass, very good even during calls where the interlocutors will be heard clearly. equipped with a small but powerful battery that allows it to cover the entire day and sometimes even the next with fairly standard use, i.e. 6/7 hours of calls or music in approximately 36 hours of use. Pairing is very simple and the BT 6.0 technology will allow good connection stability. All you have to do is remove both earphones from the socket and first of all it will connect to each other and then we will just have to search for the earphones on our device. as mentioned previously, the earphones can also be used individually and on two different devices and in this case to use only one, simply turn on the one you want to use and it will be recognized with the left and right. they are both equipped with a microphone and therefore can also be used for calls individually. do you have two smartphones? this is the best solution. below are the functions that can be performed by pressing the earpiece l/r button: short press to play music or pause earpiece l/r: short press during a call to answer or hang up earpiece l/r: press for 2 seconds to turn on earpiece l/r: press 4 seconds turning off earphone l: double click volume - / triple click progress song earphone r: double click volume + / triple click previous song if only one earphone is used the available options will be limited to turning on/off play/pause and opening and closing calls. conclusion they are earphones excellent for both work and free time, they are both beautiful to look at and to use with an audio that is the envy of many other Bluetooth earphones. Having a good 2200 mah battery we can also use it as a small powerbank in case an extra gem is needed .;0
1691;Excellent;I bought these headphones to go running and to the gym, I must say that I was amazed by the sound. but the very important thing for me was that they didn't fall while I was doing activities I finally found them!!! then another thing that I honestly didn't know that a friend of mine discovered while talking to the gym and that I can also charge my phone so super happy double shot. I was happy with my needs.;0
1692;Well; I've been using it for a month and in addition to the diffusion of the essential oil fragrance, I still haven't understood whether it works or not. the object is very nice, it has two speeds and a very discreet blue light. I use it in the office and I'm not at all bothered by the noise even at maximum speed;0
1693; Bad finishing; good print, bad finishing. after the first wash in the washing machine the finishing of the hem came undone in several places. the quality/price ratio is good but I would have liked to use it a little more without resorting to tailoring interventions. used for kindergarten.;0
1694;Small mask;the mask is well made. a little stiff. the elastics are a little too tight. I was hoping they would be a little larger than those for children and a little smaller than those for adults but no. Let's say that for my 10 to 9 year old daughter with a thin face they are absolutely right. if he talks too much he reveals his nose. I recommend them for younger children.;0
1695;Good but....;the workmanship of the masks is excellent and reflects the various certifications described. however, the small size is too small for normal adult faces: they don't cover the face well and the elastic bands are too tight and cause the ears to droop. For me they are more suitable for boys;0
1696; Ffp2 KARAEASY Small Size masks; the item corresponds to the description and arrived well packaged and quickly. everything is ok except that my 7-year-old granddaughter feels tight on her ears and the presence of a spacer for the elastic bands of the masks in the package would have been useful.;0
1697; Disgustingly cheap; one of the worst qualities around, hole too close to the edge and practically transparent material, one broke in one day, recommended by Amazon?! Madness or mockery, I don't know why it's recommended.;0
1698;Silent;I purchased this item mainly for the flies that hang around the room every day especially at night...I thought they were only for mosquitoes...I was ready to return it but I have to say that I found this lamp very useful... (update.... after using them only a couple of days now they no longer turn on, what a disappointment, I absolutely don't recommend it...;0
1699;Useless;I needed an anti-mosquito lamp for the house and this one seemed perfect. Too bad he doesn't catch a mosquito even by accident. furthermore it only connects to the German round horizontal sockets and not to the Italian ones (three vertical holes). and therefore we couldn't even attack them in the places where they would have been most useful. in short, not the product we were looking for.;0
1700; The bass is missing, otherwise perfect; bought as a gift for a friend of mine who, having a phone without a jack, wanted a pair of Bluetooth earphones. The earphones arrive in a small package. inside we find the headphones with the case (which is really small and fits in your pocket comfortably and doesn't bother you) the manual and the charging cable. for the moment she is really happy with them in 1 week of use she hasn't recharged the case yet (the use at least 2 hours a day). comfortable and has a really high volume. The touch buttons (the gray part on the headphones) are very comfortable with which you can navigate between tracks, pause or activate Google Assistant. Pairing between phone and headphones is easy and when you open the case they connect very quickly. the type-c is intelligent for charging them so you don't need different cables since it is the same connection as the phones. recommended!!;0
1701; Good product; I took some tablets and the product is valid: you can taste the propolis and it is slightly sticky to the teeth (as propolis should be). the product is at the level of other more famous ones on the market. product shipped ahead of schedule;0
1702; Convenient and useful for small jobs at home!; Very useful for small jobs and small screws. convenient for the 32 inserts present. the double type of insertion is useful depending on the different needs of use. the workmanship of the inserts is not the best but obviously for how much they cost it is more than good! advice;0
1703; Fairedear 32 in 1 Small Screwdriver Set; Small enough to put in your pocket. This kit is truly ergonomic complete with all the essentials to be able to be used if necessary. The extension is very useful and also acts as a lever by inserting it into the slot in the screwdriver handle. a flaw can be found in the small parts which are not magnetic.;0

The extension is very useful and also acts as a lever by inserting it into the slot in the screwdriver handle. a flaw can be found in the small parts which are not magnetic.;0
1706;It's rubber!!! The colors are duller than the image in the photo!!;I purchased 2 petti rugs for this Christmas. in the description it certainly says that it can be washed with a sponge.....but it was easier to say that they were made of rubber. furthermore the colors are duller/sober than those in the photo. I rate 2 stars.....;0
1707;Well, they're not bad;I was a bit skeptical about these straps, the atypical configuration compared to the original ones made me turn up my nose a bit, but I changed my mind after I tried them on. comfort and usability equal to the originals, the only flaw is that the closure cannot be precise and you want it as with the originals. Let me explain better: while with the originals the closure is easily done with one hand and a single gesture, here you always have to use one hand but use the little finger to keep the strap taut so as to have the right closure size. a little inconvenience but for the price at which they are sold it is worth it;0
1708; strong solvent-like odor and small rubber bands; it has a very strong smell of solvent and the rubber bands are extremely small and do not bother the ears. For the rest, the packaging is adequate for the contents without wasting unnecessary space and are individually sealed. I will avoid purchasing them in the future. ;0
1709; Fairly good but with defects; the mask itself is the right size because it covers well from the nose to the chin but the problems appear to be in the elastic bands which are long and you necessarily have to use a hook behind the neck (not supplied) otherwise It does not adhere well to the face. The nose wire is a little soft and must be positioned carefully so that air does not pass through. They may have an unpleasant odor compared to other 5-layer masks. They are more breathable and you need to understand if it is an advantage or a disadvantage. and finally the QR code on the mask packaging leads to an internet address that doesn't work. They leave me with doubts about the quality and effectiveness.;0
1710; Good quality Fpp2 mask; purchased with hesitation but when tested they were odorless (mine was the black version) with good elasticity and good coverage of the face, nose and mouth. the certification is verified and valid. from my experience I consider them a valid purchase.;0
1711;Poor quality, don't buy them.;More than half of the masks had one of the two elastics unsecured: one elastic was dangling when opened. so having paid 50 and there are less than 25 usable, they cost a lot. highly discouraged.;0
1712; very disappointed; the mask itself seems ok the real problem is the strong and unpleasant plastic smell it gives off which I have never smelled in any other mask before so I really think I will return them.;0
1713; Excellent quality; the product arrived packaged correctly and on time. excellent masks, the first thing you can notice is the excellent quality, they are also light enough and don't give off the bad smell that I had smelled in some, the spring wasn't the best but everything all in all it lasts the right amount of time;0
1714; Uncertainty about the authenticity of the product.; the QR code on the envelopes takes you to a non-existent site and there is no trace of the production of masks on the manufacturer's website. when cut there are 4 layers and not 5. they are a bit narrow. 30 euro cents is a good price though.;0
1715; bad smell and 2 missing; 2 masks are missing with what they cost 2 per pack are several euros that you pocket the package was half open since it has no guarantee seals so it is easy for it to be tampered with or stolen along the way but the worst thing that bleeds or has a bad odor on both blue and white ones;0
1716;Nice photo gadgets;I purchased this product to take photos of the children in my daughter's kindergarten class as a Christmas gift. the kit consists of 17 disassembled pieces. this means that you have to assemble them yourself. find the sticks (there are 19 so you have a margin of error or you can use two for the older ones) single-portion double-sided tape and the drawings. the latter are made of paper so if you have small children like me you have to pay close attention because they can break but a little is enough of scotch to recompose them. my girls enjoyed helping me and taking photos with the different subjects in the kit;0
1717;Not even.;beautiful to look at and light. very light. it goes on micro for two minutes. the problem is that the decoration is not a print on plastic but a single paper sticker like the ones on bean cans so to speak and therefore already at the first wash I had to take great care not to ruin it all.;0
1718;Ok;the mug is really cute. the design is well done but the problem is that it gets ruined quickly. after just 1 day it was already scratched (I'm referring to the design). I saw the photos of the other reviews and it's the same defect as my mug. I still give three stars because it does its job. my child drinks from it very well so I don't regret the purchase especially considering that the expense is low.;0
1719; Quality/price ok; mug arrived on time super fast as always. Very nice image of Mickey Mouse attached well for now but it doesn't give the impression that it will last very long. For the price I paid I didn't expect excellent quality, in fact that's the case. but for what I need to use it, it's more than fine. However, it is worth the money spent. Be careful, it does not seem suitable for washing in the dishwasher. microwave holds well.;0
1720;Display mug;I didn't even want to waste time commenting on this article which in my opinion for 5 is very expensive. When the package arrived I thought it was empty as the cardboard was heavier. I don't recommend it and I wouldn't buy it again. maybe I leave it just for display because the kid likes to see hulk.;0
1721;A real rip-off;I thought the cup would be better, a real disappointment. I took the cup and glued it with adhesive which, after two or three washes, even the color comes out completely. and costs around 6 euros. you could pay 2 euros for a plastic cup, I was really disappointed by the image, it looks better.;0
1722;You can be better;the mug is nice and the price is right. Unfortunately it arrived a little damaged with some missing color pieces. I honestly don't think the cover will last long since it's made of paper, let's hope for the best..;0
1723; Unsatisfactory; it is not the product I expected. It is a very light plastic cup with a card stuck around it with a print that from the images you can see is not perfect as it has white specks. I asked to return the product. It also seems impossible to me that it won't be ruined after the first wash. I don't recommend the purchase. It costs six euros but it's not worth it as a drinking cup.... perhaps as a pencil holder but given its lightness, perhaps not even for that.;0
1724;Disney Mickey Mouse mug; it is comfortable and practical, very large but the quality of the plastic is not the best after just one day of use without putting it in the microwave or dishwasher the color comes off and I honestly don't like it!;0
1725;It looks like a toy;cup?? why don't they call it what it really is which is a cheap plastic cup!!! certainly with the price I couldn't expect much but at least a little more resistant a disappointment.. the only thing that can console me is that it is suitable for the microwave!;0
1726;Completely disappointed with the item; it is not possible that the item arrived today and after the first wash it looks like this. gently washed by hand. I bought similar products and these results were visible but after months of use/washing.;0
1727;Unsafe product!;Apparently good quality lightweight plastic material with a handle for easy grip even for small children who need to learn how to hold a cup. however, during the second wash I preferred to throw it away and it was not necessary to put it in the dishwasher. in the photo you can in fact see the marks left by my baby's teeth (15 months): the decoration is easily damaged and loses its colour!! it is not a safe product!;0
1728;The graphic part is a caution sticker.;It's nice, children like it. unfortunately the graphics are only adhesive and glued. so after a few washes it fades and starts to come apart... of course you can use it anyway but it's a common red plastic cup. and that is worth 50 cents.;0
1729;TO AVOID!;the cup is very small, the materials are not of high quality and are evident from the noni on the cup. It also gives off a very unpleasant smell even after washing it. Another negative aspect is the lack of a box, in fact the cup arrives there inside the Amazon box and covering it there is only a simple plastic bag. the only positive aspect is the price which is very low but this does not justify the cup. furthermore the package arrived early.;0
1730; Functional; bought for my son to use at school. right size, not bulky to be slipped into the backpack among the books. Cap closes well, no drops of water come out. water bottle entirely made of plastic.;0
1731;Elsa water bottle;beautiful. comfortable colored practice. only flaw: if there was a closing spout it would be the best. my daughter takes it to nursery and they keep it on the desk and I didn't have a closing spout it is unhygienic.;0
1732; it is not what was ordered;" ""as per the title, I ordered a 400ml water bottle, but instead I received a smaller one with a Minecraft lunch box, I imagine as a kind of """"compensation""."" poor plastic and unfairness of the seller. not recommended. delivery as always flawless thanks to Amazon.""";0
1733;Durable plastic;the image of spiderman is printed in the plastic so it is easy to wash without it being ruined. I didn't find it comfortable. The spout has little opening so it is a little awkward to drink. To be safe, I didn't put it in the dishwasher.;0
1734; I bought it mainly for a game on Steam... but it doesn't allow me to use it to move around...; I bought it to use it with some games on Steam... for some games I'm interested in it is not compatible or you can combine functions but not the movement axes.... for others it works... that's why I gave it 3 stars...;0
1735;Recommended;insert the key and play nothing simpler. good connection, excellent battery life. the keys are sensitive and precise but a little cumbersome and noisy but otherwise I highly recommend it.;0
1736;Review by the Vanitiromance blog ⭐⭐⭐⭐ 1/2;like every ninth, Elizabeth Rose, close to Christmas, signs a novel imbued with that festive and glittering atmosphere that fills the streets and houses in the most evocative month of the ninth.;0
